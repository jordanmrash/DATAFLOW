It is used to streamline the tax package and data collection process while improving process control, data security, and the compliance process.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excel is utilized to convert and create templates via the FormsFlow Designer. Add-in the template is used to create requests for distribution with due dates, monitoring and tracking data. Flow can be used for multiple purposes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For example, you can gather Schedule M adjustment data for multiple entities by the Tax Department, creating DataFlow requests for each entity and assigning it to a user or a group. The assign user completes the requested information and the tax Department reviews it and can push the data into the provisioned or compliance system.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To create templates and gather data using ONESOURCE dataflow, the user will utilize an existing or a new excel based workbook or tax package. These workbooks should be designed in a way to efficiently collect data across all entities.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So redesign or process improvement should be considered and implemented prior to converting an excel workbook into a form&#39;s flow template, the first step is to download the excel FormsFlow Designer. Add-in to convert the data collection workbook into a FormsFlow template using the Template Design menu options. Once the workbook has been created and converted into a secure FormsFlow Template a FormsFlow email template and status template can be created in the Dataflow Setup menu. Once the template is set up, dataflow requests can be created via the Actions menu in the Dataflow Grid using the template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Information such as user assignments, due dates, and notifications can also be added. Next data providers can open the dataflow request and enter and save the requested information. The data entered in the request is saved in a secure Web based storage called the Dataflow repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The collected data can be extracted and aggregated via the dataflow add-in and can be used for review reports or integration with other applications. And administrators can monitor the status of requests, send reminders, and make changes to the DataFlow template or request information.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As we move through the DataFlow modules, there are key terms that are frequently used and are important to understand as you become familiar with the product.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The DataFlow Add-ins are available for download by administrators in ONESOURCE FileRoom. The Add-ins are loaded into excel and have two functions that can be downloaded separately or together. The first is the FormsFlow Designer Add-in, which includes the template Design menu that converts an excel workbook into a secure data gathering FormsFlow template, which is loaded into DataFlow requests are created with a template. The DataFlow Add-in includes the Data extraction Menu, which allows you to query the ONESOURCE dataflow repository and extract information gathered in dataflow requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A FormsFlow template is the workbook converted with a template design menu in the FormsFlow Designer Add-in that will be used to create dataflow requests in the product.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The FormsFlow Email template is the setup area of the form&#39;s Flow Template in DataFlow. The setup of the form&#39;s Flow Email template includes Loading the form&#39;s Flow Template file instructions for data providers that will be sent via Email Tax type, and the optional workflow process associated with the feature requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dataflow requests are requests for information gathered using a FormsFlow template. A link to the request is emailed to data providers, who then complete one form per entity period. An</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">entity is the subject of a dataflow request. Entities are set up in entity manager or entity unit browser, which can be accessed on ONESOURCE platform.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data providers are the users assigned to the DataFlow requests. They are responsible for completing the DataFlow request and saving the data to the ONESOURCE dataflow repository. Groups are a class of users utilized to assign permissions to perform actions in ONESOURCE workflow manager.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In ONESOURCE DataFlow there are two types of users in ONESOURCE DataFlow. (1) Non- licensed data providers who only see DataFlow requests they are assigned and do not have full product access and (2) licensed ONESOURCE users who have full product access and access to other applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Requests can be assigned to either type of user, multiple users, or user groups. Group codes are a way to categorize entities for filtering in the dataflow grid. The group codes must first be created, and then the entities must be assigned to those group codes. If an entity is not assigned to a group code, you will not be able to use the DataFlow function to externally create DataFlow requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Codes are used to allow the creation of a duplicate request based on template, entity name, entity ID, tax, type, year, and period. They can also be used to provide additional metadata to be available within the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Codes must be set up on the ONESOURCE platform and are not associated to a template. It is a best practice to limit the number of codes you set up as large lists of codes are inefficient to filter through when creating DataFlow requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Scenario is another field that can be used to allow the creation of a duplicate request based on template, entity name, entity ID, tax type, year period, or to provide additional metadata to be available within the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Scenario is a free form text field specific to the request. Since there are no controls over what is typed in this field, it is not the best option for driving functionality within the request. Now that you are familiar with the terminology that you need to know for DataFlow, let&#39;s talk about the rules available within DataFlow. Roles in DataFlow define the functions a user has, depending on tasks they need to perform and the security rights they have been assigned. The roles often overlap, and a single person may perform tasks designated in all three roles. The three roles in DataFlow include licensed and non-licensed users. And administrators are licensed users who perform setup tasks, including template, entity and user setup, and assign appropriate security rights. They may also create, assign, manage, and monitor dataflow requests in the Dataflow grid.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And administrators will also create and maintain FormsFlow templates and view and assimilate information, including preloading data, such as beginning balance or trial balance information. End users often also call. Designers are licensed users who create and maintain FormsFlow Templates using template design. In the FormsFlow designer add-in, they will also use the DataFlow add-in to create data extractions or preload data. Like the Administrator role, end users may also have security rights to create, assign, and monitor requests using the dataflow grid.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data providers as defined earlier in the Key terminology section, provide requested information for dataflow request they are assigned. An administrator and end user will also often be responsible for providing data for DataFlow requests. They are assigned when a user does not need to perform tasks related to the end user or the administrator roles and will only provide data in the DataFlow requests. They can be set up as a non-licensed user data provider. A data provider set up as non-licensed users will only see DataFlow requests they are assigned and will not see the full product screens in ONESOURCE DataFlow. Now that you have</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">learned what roles exist in dataflow, let&#39;s take a further look into what the administrator tasks will include.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administrators are responsible for the setup of entities, users, and groups, as well as assigning security rights within ONESOURCE DataFlow. Performing these tasks occurs and user administration ONESOURCE FileRoom administration, and ONESOURCE workflow manager set up user administration is located on platform and is where Groups are set up during implementation based on the implementation plan and system functionality. However, groups can be added as needed. Assigning a user to a group inherently provides that user the permissions for a given ONESOURCE application associated with the group.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ONESOURCE FileRoom administration is where groups specific to ONESOURCE workflow manager are set up. Dataflow is in ONESOURCE Workflow Manager, which is a module within ONESOURCE FileRoom. ONESOURCE workflow manager setup is where appropriate security rights specific to the DataFlow, menu options, and tasks are assigned.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administrators will also create status templates and FormsFlow email templates within these setups. Assigning status security permissions, due dates, creating automated emails and duration of checkout are all included. Additionally, administrators can override checkout use Roll Forward capabilities and review audit trail information. The Resources Link is designed to provide helpful resources for the user, including quick links for ONESOURCE University, as well as the ONESOURCE Customer Center, and access to OWM Support. Navigate and log into onesourcetax.com. Select Resources on the left side of the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Resources is the central location for assistance for all ONESOURCE applications. It simplifies the support experience and allows the user to quickly access and attend training that will improve their performance and usage of ONESOURCE.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">INTRO TO FORMSFLOW DESIGNER CLASSIC:</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hello, and welcome to Introduction to Forms, Flow designer. Upon completion of this module, participants will be able to explain the purpose of FormsFlow Designer demonstrate how to access and download the form&#39;s Flow Designer. Add-in explain how to use the Template Design menu to convert a workbook into a dataflow FormsFlow template and identify additional features, including Add rows, Fit text notes and attachments.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FormsFlow Designer is the tool used to take all of your excel based workbooks used to gather data and make them into templates for DataFlow. During the module, we will walk through what FormsFlow Designer is and the process of converting an excel workbook into a FormsFlow template to be used to create dataflow requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then we will learn how to access and download a FormsFlow Designer Add-in, including configuring the necessary settings. Finally, we will discuss how to use the template Design menu with the add-in.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FormsFlow designer is part of the DataFlow add-in and is required to design and convert workbooks for data collection in DataFlow. Excel functionality such as range naming, data validation, and formulas, as well as DataFlow specific functionality provided by the add-in can be used in the design process.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Workbooks are protected and converted into FormsFlow templates using the template Design menu in the Add-in. Finally, DataFlow requests are created with the templates, and data providers are assigned to requests, so data can be provided.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s look at the process of converting a workbook into a FormsFlow template used for data collection. The first step is to install the form&#39;s Flow designer add-in before you get started converting the workbook with the add-in. It is important to understand the needs of the end</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">users. It is highly recommended that you take steps to document the current data collection process and note how you would like to improve the process using DataFlow. This process, documentation and evaluation step will be ongoing throughout the implementation of DataFlow and likely the years to come as you make improvements or changes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is an important part of your success with using the product. Next, it is often recommended that you start with an existing excel workbook, which may include a tax package, questionnaire, survey, or other excel based documents used to collect data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alternatively, you can start from a blank excel workbook and design the workbook for data collection from scratch. Note that this method is not as common as most tax departments have workbook they would like to leverage to convert into a form&#39;s flow template using an existing excel workbook and making changes or redesigning areas for efficiency is often less time consuming than starting from scratch.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, the process, documentation, and evaluation should reveal the best course of action for your specific needs. Once you have the excel workbook you wish to use. The next step is to define the input cell by fill color using the Fill menu option in template Design, it is recommended you choose a lighter color as opposed to a bright or dark color so that data can easily be seen when it is entered into those cells. After that, range names will need to be applied to all input cells. Range names are required for input cells as this is how the data is saved in the data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Range names can be added using excel functionality in the Name Manager or using the form&#39;s Flow Designer. Add-in Range naming functionality. Additional features, which can include excel format requirements like conditional formatting and data validation or DataFlow specific features can also be added.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DataFlow features include add rows, fit text and notes and documents features that can be designed within the template. Next reports should be run to review or change range names, ensure the template will run efficiently and to clear diagnostic errors.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You will also configure the runtime menu options that control the menu and toolbar that will be available to data providers, including functions like Save, Add rows and Fit text. Last, you will protect the template using Protect in the Template Design menu and save the protected file.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This last step makes the workbook read only, and users will not be able to make any edits except to the input or unlocked cells. Now you can create the FormsFlow template. In the DataFlow Setup menu and browse for and load the protected template file created with the FormsFlow designer add-in. Finally, you are able to create DataFlow requests via the Actions menu using the FormsFlow template loaded into DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www/" class="a" target="_blank">Now we will discuss how to download a FormsFlow Designer add-in so we can look at the template design menu options in further detail. The FormsFlow designer add-in can be downloaded from ONESOURCE FileRoom by FileRoom administrators and made available to all users prior to downloading the add-in, please be sure you have the following requirements on your system. Windows Seven or greater, Office 2007 or greater, and Internet Explorer Nine or greater. You will access FileRoom by logging into </a>www. Dot ONESOURCEtacks.com from the navigation bar at the top of the screen, select the FileRoom icon to launch ONESOURCE FileRoom. Select the Add-ins icon from the menu options on the left within the Add-ins screen, select the download button next to the FormsFlow. Add-in Description and run the installation. Note that since access to the Add-ins requires FileRoom administrator rights, and administrators may need to save and share the Add-in with users who will be designing and converting workbooks as necessary.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Next, we will install the Add-in. After selecting Run, follow the Install Shield prompts. Alternatively, you may download the Add-in right click and Select Run as Administrator. Then</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">follow the InstallShield prompts. Check both FormsFlow designer, and DataFlow add-in. The first step of the InstallShield prompts the DataFlow add-in will be covered in the data extraction training modules, but it can be downloaded and installed with the FormsFlow designer add-in. Once the add-ins are installed in excel, you may need to enable the add-in if you do not see the DataFlow tab in the excel tab menu options. To enable the add-in, click the Office button or File Tab, depending on your excel version.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Select the Options menu and select add-ins from the left menu bar. At the bottom of the Add- ins screen, Select Add-ins from the Manage Drop Down box, and then Select Go. You will choose ONESOURCE DataFlow and ONESOURCE DataFlow Connect Add-ins and then select OK.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In excel, select the DataFlow Tab, the FormsFlow Designer menu items are grouped within template design. Add-in Settings will also need to be configured. In excel. Select the DataFlow Tab settings. Add-in settings.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Design Tab contains settings for template design. Last Cell Report threshold allows you to define the last cell. The report will check when running the Last Cell report in the Reports menu. Run design functions. Executes hide functions in the template. It is important to be aware that there is no way to unhide the executed hides after you select this option.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Protected in Sheets protects worksheets that are hidden prior to protecting the template. If this option is not selected, any hidden Sheets would not be protected when the template is converted using the form&#39;s Flow Designer Add-in.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now that the FormsFlow Designer add-in is installed, let&#39;s take a more in depth look at the template Design menu. The Template Design menu options in the FormsFlow Designer Add-in allow you to create and convert an excel workbook into a secure FormsFlow template that can be used for data collection in DataFlow. The menu options will facilitate that process.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The new template option is used when starting from a blank excel workbook that was not previously formatted and designed in excel. After selecting new template, you will be prompted to designate an input color.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The input color will be used throughout the template designed to designate cells that are available for data entry. Once the input color is selected, the workbook is marked as a FormsFlow template and the Set Input Color fill and Names menu options activate. As mentioned before, this is not the most typical course of action as most users are not starting from scratch with a blank file. Mark FormsFlow is used for an existing excel file. Select Mark FormsFlow to activate the template design features. After selecting Mark FormsFlow, you will be prompted to designate your input color.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Set input color will automatically prompt you when you select new template or Mark FormsFlow. This input color will be used throughout the template to designate which cells should be available. For a user to provide data, you can choose to change your input color after initially setting it, but only one input color is allowed.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Note that an existing workbook that is being converted to a form&#39;s flow template may already use a fill color to designate the cells for data input. Ensure you choose the correct color if you wish to use the input color in the original workbook.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fill allows you to designate cells with the input color by selecting the desired cell or cells and selecting fill located in the template Design menu. Range names must be assigned to the input cells because the range name is how data is stored in the dataflow repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Single cells can be named using excel Name Manager and range names can also be applied to groups of non-input cells for use in excel Functions and Data validation. Within the Names</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">menu option. In template design, there are DataFlow range naming options available that can be used in addition to the excel Naming feature.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assign wildcard Name allows you to name two or more rows of cells in a single column. To use this method, you will choose a range name base for the selected cells and designate the Save method. This naming method is most commonly used when the number of records will vary from one request to another and is often used with the add rows group.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Add Table allows you to range name data across multiple rows and columns. Data is stored efficiently and can be extracted or queried from a table, but data cannot be sent to. Action functions. So this limitation needs to be carefully considered.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Assign repeating cell name is used for input cells only to name multiple columns and. Or multiple rows. This naming method opens a numeric suffix to arrange name base for the number of cells you have selected.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Repeating cell name is an older functionality and was replaced with wildcard names, which is often the recommended method for efficiency and functionality. Assign block name is used for a large selection of data where you won&#39;t need to query specific cells. The data in these cells is saved in one range name the cells must be marked for input with a fill color and must be in contiguous columns and rows.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Block name is commonly used for trial balance information. Rename Cells allows you to rename a single cell. Automatic Names assigns a unique name to each input cell that hasn&#39;t already been previously named.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Automatic names can be used to name input cells that do not need to be extracted and is one of the last setup items. The cells must be marked for input using the designated fill color. They can also be removed using the Remove flyout menu option.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When range naming cells, there are additional best practice recommendations to keep in mind. Underscores or periods are okay, but no other special characters are allowed. Names cannot contain spaces or leading numbers.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shorter names are more efficient, so in the more than eight to twelve characters is recommended. Referencing the worksheet and field in the range. Name helps to identify where the name is located and makes creating DataFlow extraction workbooks easier. For example, if a tab is named Lead Sheet and Cell B two is asking for the address.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A good range name for that cell would be LS_B2_ address. Use a letter in the name to indicate the worksheet and to keep the name short. Template Design also offers additional features in the Name menu.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fit Text allows input fields to expand to the size of the data entered. Add Rows Group allows you to design a section capable of adding additional rows when data providers may need them. Notes allows the data provider the ability to attach a note within the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Attachments allows the data provider the ability to attach supporting materials within the request. During the module we walked through what FormsFlow Designer is used for, and the process of converting an excel workbook into a FormsFlow template to be used to create DataFlow requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then, we learned how to access and download a FormsFlow Designer add-in, including requirements and configuring the necessary settings. Finally, we discussed how to use the template design menu in the Add-in to Mark the form&#39;s Flow template, define input cells, fill input cells, and range name.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">INTRODUCTION TO DATAFLOW EXTRACTION CLASSIC:</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DataFlow extraction is the tool used to query the dataflow repository and aggregate all the data gathered in the DataFlow requests. During the module, we will walk through what dataflow extraction is and the process of using DataFlow, including key terms often seen and used with a tool.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Next, we will learn how to access and download the dataflow add-in, including configuring the necessary settings. Then we will review the dataflow extraction menu options and how to use them. Finally, we will discuss the extraction functions offered in the Add-in and their uses.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DataFlow extraction is part of the DataFlow Add-in and allows for querying and reporting on data gathered in dataflow requests. The dataflow add-in uses EXT function methods, which mimic excel formulas to extract data stored in tables in the dataflow repository into excel worksheets using DataFlow extraction, enables users to combine data from multiple tables for a report, or build excel reporting workbooks for printing.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It also enables users to query data for integration with other products or send data into the repository prior to data entry by data providers. The process of using DataFlow extraction is. Two. First, install the DataFlow Add-in if it wasn&#39;t previously installed with the FormsFlow Designer Add-in. Next, evaluate and understand the reporting or integration needs for administrators or users.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This discovery would have likely been done with the Process Documentation step for FormsFlow designer but should be revisited. Now that the FormsFlow templates are created, you will start with an excel workbook and register the Add-in by selecting Register and entering your ONESOURCE login credentials. This step connects the Add-in to your DataFlow repository the DataFlow functions appear in excel when the add-in is installed. To see the functions, select the insert Function button next to the excel Formula bar, select ONESOURCE DataFlow from the Category Drop Down list, and all DataFlow functions will be listed in the frame.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use the EXT DataFlow functions and the Get and Set DataFlow menu options to extract data from or send data to the repository. There are many different formulas that can be used depending on the range naming method used in design of a template. The data queried from the DataFlow repository is typically used to create reports or used for integration with other products. Prior to reviewing how to download and use the Add-in, let&#39;s look at key terminology used with dataflow extraction. The dataflow repository is decentralized and secure storage location where data from all DataFlow requests is held for access by users when a request is opened, or when data is extracted.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A tag range is a list of XML tag names better known in the FormsFlow template as range names that will be depending on the function retrieved from or written to the dataflow repository. An input range is a range that contains a list of your XML tag names. This term is synonymous with tag range or range names but is used as an argument when the DataFlow formula is typed in excel ExtDFPut functions for the range of values to load.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Template ID is the unique identifier assigned to a form&#39;s flow email template when it is created in DataFlow. Request ID is the unique identifier assigned to a DataFlow request when it is created. This ID is returned in the first column when using the ExtDFGetList function and as a single value when using the ExtDFGetID function.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The output range is a single cell row or a column of the same dimensions as the tag range that specifies where the data from the request should be displayed or written to in excel. Next, we will review how to access and download the DataFlow at in the DataFlow Add-in used for data extraction can be downloaded from ONESOURCE FileRoom by FileRoom Administrators and made available to all licensed users. If you have already successfully downloaded the FormsFlow Designer, add-in and check both.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.onesourcetax.com/" class="a" target="_blank">The FormsFlow designer and DataFlow add-in the first step of the InstallShield prompts, you already have the data extraction piece of the add-in. There is no need to download the add-in again. As a reminder, to access FileRoom you will log into </a>www.onesourcetax.com with your login credentials.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From the navigation bar at the top of the screen, select the FileRoom icon to launch ONESOURCE FileRoom. Select the Add-ins icon from the menu options on the left and select the Download button next to the dataflow. Add-in description and run the installation. After selecting Run, follow the Install shield prompts. Alternatively, you may download the Add-in right click and select “Run as administrator”. Then follow the InstallShield prompts. If you haven&#39;t already downloaded the FormsFlow Designer add-in and will need to use it. Check to install both add-ins in the first step of the InstallShield prompts in excel, select the DataFlow tab and the DataFlow extraction menu items are grouped within Data extraction.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is important that you register the Add-in by selecting Register and entering your ONESOURCE login credentials. After selecting Register, a prompt appears requesting your credentials, as well as the data center for the DataFlow connection.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Complete the username and password fields and then select the appropriate data center, depending on your region. Add-in Settings will also need to be configured in excel within the DataFlow Tab, Settings, Add-in Settings. The General tab contains settings for the DataFlow add-in. Data Center sets the default Data center the add-in should connect to. The “only recommend important updates” checkbox prevents the download update dialog from appearing unless it is an important update. Update Links allows the add-in to notify and automatically update links to the new add-ins. The extraction tab contains settings for extraction. Cache function result instructs the add-in to hold information in the cache for reuse. CSV output folder. designates the folder where CSV files are placed when the write CSV function and menu option are used. Now that the DataFlow add-in is installed, and settings are configured, let&#39;s learn about the Data extraction Menu.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Data extraction menu options in the add-in allow you to query or push data into the dataflow repository, as well as create DataFlow requests from an excel file, delete ranges, and write csv files. The menu options that facilitate that process are as follows: Get processes all DataFlow functions that retrieve data from the DataFlow repository. Set processes all functions that send data to the repository. Create processes the ExtDFCreateRequest functions to create dataflow requests from the excel workbook. Instead of using the new Dataflow Request Actions Menu option in the DataFlow Grid. Delete Ranges processes the ExtDFEraseTags functions to remove tag values in the repository for a specified request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This function deletes data and should only be used if it is a part of a design solution and always used with caution. Write CSV processes the ExtDFWriteCSV functions in the worksheet. These functions Write csv files from the data in the worksheet. Bypassing the excel Save as option.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Batch processing processes multiple DataFlow requests and functions at once.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is often used to load trial balance data to multiple DataFlow requests simultaneously. Next, we will introduce the DataFlow extraction functions that will run when you use these menu options. The extraction functions are found in excel when the DataFlow add-in is loaded and are used for sending data to and getting data from the repository. Select the insert Function button next to the excel Formula bar and select ONESOURCE DataFlow from the Category Drop Down list, and all DataFlow functions will be listed in the frame.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you select the function, you will see a listing of function arguments unique to that formula that can be entered. If all arguments are answered correctly, the cell containing the function will display “#ready to pull”, “#ready to push#” or “#ready to create” depending on the type of formula you entered after the function runs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After the function runs the Data extraction menu options in the dataflow Add-in, a date and timestamp will display.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are many available functions offered with the Add-in. ExtDFCreateRequest allows you to create a new DataFlow request with specified properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The request ID of a new request is returned in the cell containing the formula. Select create from the DataFlow many to run the function. The following two functions are often used to retrieve the request IDs needed in any function that will be used to send or repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To run these functions, select Get from the Data Extraction menu in the Add-in. ExtDFGetList allows you to query the dataflow repository using fields found in the dataflow grid filters, and returns all values that match that criteria, including the request ID.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ExtDFGetID is similar to ExtDFGetList, but returns only a single request ID, matching the criteria entered in the function arguments. The arguments need to be specific so that the function can find one exact match, or no ID will be returned. You will use the Set menu option in the Data Extraction menu to send data to the repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following functions will send data. ExtDFPutValues allows you to insert values into the dataflow repository for a specific request using Range names. ExtDFPutSingleValue allows you to insert a single value into dataflow repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ExtDPutBlock allows you to write a block of data into a single tag named with a block range name. There are many functions that will retrieve data from the repository. Deciding on which function should be used will be dependent on what data you are trying to query, and the range names used for that data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following functions will use the Get menu option in the Data extraction menu. ExtDFGetValues allows you to extract two or more values for a specific request ID. This function can be used to build a table inside excel. ExtDFGetValues allows you to extract two or more values for a list of requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You will often use ExtDFGetList first to retrieve a list of IDs first and then refer to those IDs in this function. ExtDFGetSingleValue returns a value for a request ID, and one tag name into the cell with the formula.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ExtDFGetBlock allows you to retrieve data stored in block range. ExtDFGetTable allows you to retrieve data stored in a Table range. ExtDFLoadWildcard returns data from a Wildcard range and can be used to move data from one request to another, or to link data between multiple requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ExtDFWildcardTable allows you to append data in Wildcard ranges from multiple requests. EXDFConsolidateWildCard allows you to summarize and Merrick value for a range of Wildcard Tags for specified requests. This function eliminates a step if you were to query the values using ExtDFLoadWildCard and then used Excel sum formulas.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ExtDFConsolidateValues returns the sum of values for each tag across specified requests. This function. Eliminates a step if you were to query the values using ExtDFGetValues and then used excel Sum formulas. ExtDFGetXML returns all range, name Tags, and values from a request in two columns: Tag and Value.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This function is useful to verify range names for other functions. ExtDFCreateTable is a combination of ExtDFGetList and ExtDFGetXML and extracts all data for all requests that match criteria. And finally, ExtDFWriteCSV allows you to export query data from the excel workbook to a csv file, which facilitates integration with other software that you see CSV files. When the function is run, the file is sent to the output file path specified in Add-in settings.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">USING DATAFLOW CLASSIC:</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The DataFlow grid lists all of the request that match the search criteria.

Notice the dataflow pop up for the validation process. Dataflow verifies the user&#39;s rights to the DataFlow and loads the request properties into the reserved fields.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data providers can modify the status of request assigned to them. Remember, administrators can create status templates that specify which users can change the status, and the status template is selected when the form Slow template is created.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data providers can attach supporting documents and review attached documents by clicking docs. The document icon displays in the left-hand column for any request with a document attached. Data providers can also add notes to the request or review existing notes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notes can include review notes, recommended changes, resolutions, and a closed status. This allows the Notes feature to provide a sign off method if the request isn&#39;t associated with a ONESOURCE workflow, an icon displays in the left-hand column when a notice attached.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notice that this request has both a document and a note attached.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the data provider has entered the requested information in the workbook, the data provider menu and toolbar have a Save option, which tours the information. In the DataFlow Data repository, the choices displayed on the menu and toolbar are selected when the FormsFlow template is created.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For example, data providers can use the Add rows and Fit Text menu selections to apply those features to areas of the workbook configured to use them. These features are covered in more depth in the FormsFlow Designer Web seminars.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Options button next to the logout selection allows the data provider to open and save a pdf copy of the Data Provider User guide. In summary, you learn that the dataflow grid display can be customized.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Actions menu contains selections to allow administrators to manage requests. FormsFlow templates specify the settings for the request to be created in default.

Clicking the dataflow login link in the Notification Email opens this dataflow login screen. The data provider grid contains several command buttons, a list of dataflow requests, search criteria to filter the list options, and a logout button.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Search criteria dropdowns along the top allow you to filter the list of dataflow requests displayed on the screen, moving down a bit. The command buttons are for managing the specific dataflow request that you&#39;re working with. The Options link is useful for configuring user options and accessing the user guide and logout closes the data provider grid.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Click the Open command button, or double click on the row of a dataflow request. To open it. An open request is considered checked out and can be edited only by the one who opened it. Others accessing the request will receive it in a read only format. The checkout duration can be managed by administrators, the dataflow provider will complete the workbook and then save the data back to the dataflow repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The FormsFlow menu and toolbar are configured when the FormsFlow template is created using runtime options. Save Data saves the information provided to the dataflow repository. Select Load Data to reload the saved data in the repository back to the form. This will override any unsaved changes and is not typically made available.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To data providers, clear data removes all input from the page and also is not generally made available to data providers. Duplicate page add rows and fit text are usually only made available to data providers on workbooks that have the feature activated. Duplicate page allows the active worksheet to be duplicated if the feature was enabled on that page.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Add rows available when highlighting a selection with the feature activated, it will prompt the data provider for the number of rows to add Fit text is available when highlighting a section with that feature activated and will modify the cell to fit the entered text, and the print option will print the current worksheet or the entire workbook.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data providers will enter the requested data in the marked input cells, just as they would in a non-FormsFlow enabled workbook, depending on the protection choice made when the template was protected. The tab key will either move through the data input cells or through all cells. In either case, they will not be able to enter information in protected cells, only in the input cells.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To update the status from the data provider grid, click the Status Command button. The default status template is pre-configured with not started in progress and completed when the request</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is opened for the first time. The status changes to in progress. Administrators can modify the status template or create additional status templates.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Status of Completed sends email notifications to the individuals or groups specified in the Completion notification. Emails of the Email template. Data providers and administrators can add, view, or delete documents.

Please note not all drawers in FileRoom will have DataFlow activated. If there is not a workflow manager icon for a specific drawer, then DataFlow will not exist in that drawer. After you have successfully logged into ONESOURCE DataFlow, the screen you will see is the DataFlow grid. The DataFlow grid is where DataFlow requests are created.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using the example of gathering data for Schedule M adjustments. This is where the tax Department creates the Schedule M DataFlow requests for each entity so that it can be made available to a data provider to provide that adjustment information that needs to be gathered. The Schedule M Adjustment DataFlow requests can be assigned or reassigned to a user or a group. Periodic email reminders can be sent, and the request status can be changed all within the grid.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many other tasks related to the DataFlow requests, such as editing the requests properties, attaching documents and notes, and viewing request history can also be performed in the DataFlow grid. The DataFlow grid displays information about DataFlow requests using Display headers. The Display headers include entity name, Entity ID, group codes, Tax Type, template Name, workflow template, Year, Period, Status, Due Date, Version Number, jurisdiction, codes, scenario, and assigned user. The headers can be moved and ordered to your preference by a click Drag and drop. This allows the user to see the dataflow grid customized to their viewing preference. The requests can be sorted by a header, alphabetically or numerically in ascending or descending order by clicking a Header menu.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To group requests by one or multiple headers, drag a header or headers directly above the grid to the drag a column here to group by heading. The filter options are located to the left of the grid and allow for searching within and narrowing the request list view in the dataflow grid.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here, you can search for requests by information included in the display headers or you could filter to all requests assigned to a specific user, group or created by a specific user.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The filters include lookup lists and drop-down menu options. If you were to log into dataflow and needed to review DataFlow requests for the Schedule M adjustments for specific entities, you could choose to fill to the request list by template name to view only the requests with the Schedule M adjustment template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Furthermore, you could also filter the request to those with the status in review and assigned to you, so you only see the specific requests you need at that moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here you can also choose to view archive dataflow requests by selecting the Archive checkbox below the search filters. Once you have provided filter options and select search the dataflow grid, view widens and the filter options pane is hidden.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If no results are found to match your filters, the grid will be empty. To bring the filter options back in view, select the toggle bar on the left of the dataflow grid. You can also turn the toggle option off by selecting My preferences to the left of the Actions menu and unchecking the autohide Search Options box after searching.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Next we will explore the Actions menu. The Actions Menu button is in the top right corner, just above the DataFlow grid. When you click the Actions button, the menu opens. The available choices depend upon the user security rights, and whether or not a request is selected.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Without a request selected, the following options are available: New DataFlow Request, Export, customize View, Save Preferences, and Save Preferences for All.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The other menu options require requests to be selected and are as follows: Customize Template, DataFlow Properties, Delete DataFlow requests, Archive DataFlow Requests, override checkout, Send Reminders, DataFlow Notes, Change Request Status, DataFlow Documents, Assign User, Request History, Roll Forward Requests, and Recalculate Requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Note that some of the menu choices can apply to multiple requests when they are selected, or, in the case of customized template, no requests if that option is not enabled for the template.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each Action menu option has a specific function.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">New dataflow Request allows you to create one where multiple DataFlow requests via an application guided four step process. Step One Select an entity or entities to create requests for the entity list is sorted in alphabetical order by entity or topic name. You can page through the list using the bottom left arrows, or you can use the filter pane on the left of the dialog box to find specific entities you are looking for.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Step two, choose the FormsFlow template and assign the appropriate version, tax type, year period, and optional jurisdiction. Step three, assign due date, users, or groups, and choose to notify the users assigned and add optional codes or scenarios. Note that you may also.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Go back to the previous step by selecting previous or you may also Select Finish if you do not wish to make these assignments at this time. Step Four Select Workflow Instances to bind allows you to confirm the workflow if a workflow was specified on the form&#39;s Flow Email template, and then finish the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Export will export the currently filtered Grid View screen into an excel file that you can open or save. Customize View allows you to show or hide column grid headers that appear in the dataflow Grid screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Save references, saves the customized view settings and header order for the dataflow grid screen, so they remain the same each time you log into the product. Save Preferences for all Saves the customized view settings and header order for the dataflow grid screen for all users.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Select the request for the remaining Actions Menu options to activate. Customize template allows you to customize. A DataFlow request at the template level without changing the source template associated with the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be able to use the Allow customization feature, the user would need the latest version of the FormsFlow Designer add-in the correct permissions assigned in setup, and the Allow customization permissions must be applied to the template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is not a feature the typical client would use, since it does allow for template changes within a request and therefore diminishes the standardization and control DataFlow provides as well as can cause loss of data. DataFlow properties will activate when a single request is selected and allows you to view and.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Change select properties assigned to the request. These properties include workflow template, entity name or number, year period, due date, jurisdiction scenario codes, or status. Delete dataflow requests allows you to select one or multiple requests to delete.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Archive dataflow requests allows you to select one or multiple requests to archive. This will make the DataFlow request inactive, also known as Read only and it will be hidden from view in the dataflow grid, but not delete it. You can view the archived requests using the checkbox below the left hand dataflow grid filter.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Override checkout is an administrator option. This menu option is active when a data provider or other user has the DataFlow request. Open. Requests can only be edited by one user at a time. If the request is in use, secondary users will be able to open the request as read only.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data cannot be saved to the request in read only view. A user must use the override checkout function to check the request back in. The next user will then be able to make edits and save data. When a checkout is overwritten, the data is not automatically saved.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This functionality is generally used when a request is incorrectly displaying as checked out in the application by a user for editing, but they are in fact not editing or in the request. Send reminders allows you to select one or multiple requests. To generate a reminder. Email.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Reminder Email text is set up in the FormsFlow Email template set up by an administrator. Dataflow Notes allows you to access a Notes screen where you can add, Resolve, close view, and delete one or more Notes. The Actions menu within the Notes screen allows you to export one or multiple Notes into excel. When a note has been added to a request, a yellow Note icon appears to the left of the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the dataflow grid. Change Request Status allows you to change the status of the DataFlow request. The available status options are dependent on the status template assigned to the request FormsFlow template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The default statuses are not started in progress. Completed Status templates and security rights assigned to those statuses are created and assigned to FormsFlow Templates in setup. DataFlow Documents allows you to attach documents to the DataFlow request. When a document has been added to a request, a paper document icon appears to the left of the request in the dataflow grid.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Documents attached to the request are also filed in the FileRoom drawer. Assign user allows you to assign users or groups to one or multiple requests. And users can be notified via email using the Notify checkbox.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The email sent to these users is formulated in the form&#39;s Flow template Setup area. Request history allows you to see the Audit Trail report from the time the DataFlow request was created to the current time. This includes when it was created, opened, saved, or when a status was changed, and by which user the report can also be exported to an excel file.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Roll Forward Requests will pull data from the selected requests. And push that data into new requests for a different year period or template via a mapping file. Dataflow uses a six step roll forward wizard to step users through the process.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recalculate requests is the automatic equivalent of manually opening, saving, and closing a DataFlow request. This feature can be used when an updated version of the FormsFlow template assigned to the request has been loaded, or for request linking functionality.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In these examples, there may be any values that need to be calculated or pulled into the template and save to the dataflow repository, but actual data entry into the request is not necessary. Within the request history, the three step recalculation cycle request triggered for recalculation, request edited and request saved will be complete when the request is properly recalculated.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now we will review the setup menu. The setup menu is where forms, flow templates, and status templates setup occurs, and DataFlow specific user permissions are assigned. The setup menu is only available to administrators.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To navigate the setup, select the Setup Menu option to the left of the dataflow grid below the DataFlow Request Filter options. The setup options that are utilized for dataflow are DataFlow, where the form&#39;s flow templates and status templates are added and edited.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Security within the Security Menu option, there is a dataflow Manager category. When this is expanded, you will see many options that pertain to security rights. This is where an administrator would assign security groups to specific security permissions within DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reports Reports will allow you to view a listing of dataflow requests that have been deleted. During the module we walked through.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DataFlow Classic Batch Administration:</h1><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hello and welcome to ONESOURCE dataflow Batch Administration for ONESOURCE workflow Manager, please note our Copyright information for proprietary materials and our Software License Agreement. If you have any questions related to this information, please send an email to onesource Training Request at Thomson.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reuters.com upon completing this session. The student will be able to utilize batch processing to process DataFlow requests, retrieve the request ID value from multiple requests, and create dataflow requests in both. The agenda for this course includes an introduction batch Administration batch Processing request creating and roll forward.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We will begin with an introduction to ONESOURCE dataflow administration and cover the purpose and process of dataflow. Batch Processing ONESOURCE dataflow gives you the ability to simultaneously process multiple requests. The dataflow add-in must be installed, and this function is available only for administrators.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A FileRoom. Additionally, a workbook must be created with dataflow functions and range names listed. A workbook containing DataFlow functions to be applied, range names to be processed if applicable, and a list of dataflow request ids for processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our DataFlow will process every applicable function in the workbook to a list of dataflow request ids. This is useful for pushing data to multiple requests, and can also be used to clear values from request.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this section on Batch administration, we will explore retrieving the request list and the batch processing file dataflow assigns a unique ID number to every request created. This number is used to process the requests. Df. Collection request ID is an argument in many dataflow functions.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This value tells the system to which specific request it is to reflect. To get the request ID of requests. Use the df Get list function to return a list of dataflow requests. O range is the only required field, even though multiple arguments are bolded. The selection in this example indicates the cell in which to start entering the request ids. Additional fields are available to filter the results by entering other arguments. The returned request list.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dfget is a function to return a single request ID. This returns a single value and does not require any arguments. However, an error will occur if more than one request is returned, and unlike df get List, no index values are returned.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The function must be filtered to return. A. These are the function arguments for the df. Get ID function. V. Entity ID is the entity ID from Entity Manager v. Entity name is the entity name from the entity manager. And vxl template name is the name of the FormsFlow template used in the V template refers to the system assigned template ID, and is a unique identifier.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vtax type is for the tax type assigned to the request. Ve refers to the year assigned to the request. This list is managed in FileRoom, administration, and. V period is the time period to which the request is assigned. This list is also managed in file df. Get ID. Arguments are as follows. Vstatus. Is the current status of the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This can be customized in setup, DataFlow status templates. V. Jurisdiction is the jurisdiction of the request and this list is managed in platform menu Setup centralized list. V codes refers to the assigned code of the request and is used to categorize request. The list is managed in platform menu setup, centralized list, and V scenario is the scenario value for the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It contains a tree text. The last two DF get ID. Arguments are the client name, which takes the client name value from the client manager. This is for Client manager enabled databases. And v client number, which refers to the client number field and is also for client.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Batch processing. Will process retrieval and send it functions. Request ids to be processed must be listed. Use df. Get list to get the request ids. The first step is to find the request ids to process.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To avoid confusion, work with a single template and single set of range names. Filter the df get list functions by the vxl template name argument, so only requests using that excel template are displayed. This will avoid error.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In excel, enter the equal sign Dfget list, left, parenthese, right, parentheses in a cell, then select the fx button. Enter the excel template name in the vxl template Name field. The returned request will be using the selected.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Retrieve range names from the template. Perform a range name report on the template. Formsflow Designer Add-in must be installed. The user must be a workflow manager administrator to have permission to download the Add-in. Navigate to setup dataflow FormsFlow templates select a template to open the template file, Select View current template save and open.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The template. You can perform a Name Range Report on the template. Select Add-ins Forms, Flow Designer Range Name report. A copy of each sheet will be created. Range names will be populated in the cell. This provides a visual representation of the template. The font is displayed in Red for easy recognition.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Range Name Report simplifies the review rather than looking through with the template open in excel. Select Add-ins FormsFlow Designer Range Name Report Note sets of names</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are populated in the respective cells or at the top of the range. Note that wildcard range names do not populate individual cell names in the ranged Name Report. It is the range name base of the Wildcard name that displays copy and paste range names from the template to the batch processing file. Replace the dot question Mark as well as runtime options with zero.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One. Two. There is an alternative method for obtaining range names. An xml retrieve using the dataflow add-in will retrieve all range names. The user does not have to be an administrator.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Values contained in the request are displayed, and range names are listed along with the corresponding value.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dataflow function DF. Get xml retrieves the DataFlow. Add-in displays all range names in the request, including associated values. Each Wildcard value is listed. Block information is not displayed. The dataflow function to use is DF.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Get xml left print cdf get xml arguments include L data collection request ID, the request ID portion of the request and. O range for output range in which to designate the cell to begin output of the request list out the request ids, range, names and values. If you are sending information to requests, consider copying additional index values. This defines which request is being modified, such as.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The list, year, Entity name, Entity ID values the spreadsheet contains the Request ID index values to classify the request and values to push into the request. Now we&#39;ll move to dataflow Batch Processing and look at an overview and batch options.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The dataflow Add-in and FileRoom Add-in must be installed. To access the batch processing screen, navigate to excel.

This performs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An X enable the checkbox for the desired actions, then click Execute the more functions that are processed, the longer the processing will take. A dialog box such as this will alert you that the process is complete. Click OK.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Functions that have been processed will be replaced. Note that while both retrieval and send data functions are processed, they do not occur in the same order. The data retrieval functions may not reflect.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The updated values sent during the same batch process. In learning about request creation, we will cover the manual process and the add-in process. Dataflow requests can be created in bulk using the new DataFlow Request wizard. Open Dataflow from the platform.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Applications dataflow module navigate to Actions new dataflow Request Enable checkboxes for the desired entity or entities. Search criteria are available to filter the entities. Here is a larger image of the process.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multiple entities can be selected. Continuing in the manual process, select the templates names include the email template name listed in the Setup dataflow FormsFlow Templates Select index values for the new requests, including tax type, year period, and jurisdiction.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The jurisdiction comes from platform menu, setup, centralized lists. Here is the example. Navigate to dataflow Actions. Add New. Click Next, then click next. The tax type, year and period are drop down fields and jurisdiction is a look. The next screen allows you to assign due dates and assign the request to users or groups. Enter a scenario, assign codes, and then here is the example assign a due date, users or group.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Groups, Scenario and code. Click Finish to create the request. By using the dataflow. Add-in. Requests can be created with a single click. Use the df Create Request function. One function will create one request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multiple functions are used to create multiple requests. Enter df. Create request. Open parentheses. Closed parentheses. Enter the function field. Select the function icon. Fx to insert a function. Enter or point to function two cells containing the required fields. When creating a request, then populate the entity ID, entity name, excel template, Year and period.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Required fields are the same using the add-in as they enter additional fields into the function arguments or point the function to cells that contain field values, such as user assigned. This sets the user to whom the request is to be assigned. Only one user can be assigned when using df. Create request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Value is the ONESOURCE universal ID. Notify by email is a true or false statement. Email will be sent to the assigned user after the request. Multiple df create request functions can be written to create multiple requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">List index values is carried out through the Add a df. Create request function. Next to each set of index values. Select Add-ins dataflow. Create new requests to run all the function. This example shows us multiple df. Create request functions and the index values.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this section for Roll Forward after an overview, we&#39;ll walk through the rollforward wizard and the alternative method. Dataflow has a built in roll forward wizard. It uses a mapping template to roll forward values. For example, ending balances can be placed into the beginning balances field in the new requests. This process runs overnight. The DataFlow add-in can be used to perform the same actions, resulting in instantaneous.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Request creation. It does involve some additional setup and dataflow add-in must be installed. Open the DataFlow module from Inside workflow Manager. Launch dataflow from platform applications. Select the Dataflow request to roll forward search criteria is available. Use the Shift and Control keys to select multiple requests. Access via the Actions menu. Roll.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Forward request here&#39;s the example. In dataflow. Select the requests to Roll forward. Remember, you can use the search criteria to narrow the listed requests. Select actions. Roll forward requests. Populate the template file with the range names to transfer to the new request source. Field represents the current request range name.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Destination field represents the range name, and the new request. Source field and destination can be the same. Value will be copied to the same range name. Save the mapping file as xls or xlsx format. Next, Select Browse. Choose the mapping template and click upload, click the hyperlink for validate mapping. The system will scan the mapping template and display any errors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The system will alert you if there are any errors in the mapping template. Arrange name not existing in the template is a common error verified that the range name is not misspelled. A csv error report can be downloaded for further review. Click next.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Select the index values for the new requests. Fold fields are required. Other fields can be selected on this screen as well. Click next to continue using the rollforward wizard. Roll forward the due date by three, six, nine or twelve months.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manually assign a due date that all the new requests will use. Select the drop down options to adjust the due date forward or backwards for Weekends, then click next. Select other components to roll forward to be copied to the new request, including dataflow Notes, closed Notes and dataflow documents. Documents will be copied to the new request. Click next.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Keep assigned users from existing requests. Enable the checkbox to notify by email. Assign all requests to new users or groups do not assign any users to the new requests. The login user will be automatically notified when the row forward is complete. Other users and or groups can be selected to be notified. Click Finish to complete.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The dataflow add-in can be used to create requests. Information can be pushed into the request manually. Dataflow add-in must be installed. Mapping template can be used to ensure the values go to the right place in the new request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Range names for values that need to follow to the new request are used to transfer the information. The new request can be created in a matter of minutes instead of waiting overnight. The alternative method involves the df get list which request IDs of the existing request to be rolled using the Add-in method, dataflow get retrieves values from the existing request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Df. Create request creates the new request, and df push values puts values from old requests into the new request. Either copy the values into the same fields in the new request, or into different fields.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Step one is to get a list of request ids that need to be rolled forward. Use df. Get List to retrieve the list of request ids. Type in equals Dfget. List left print C, right parentheses in an empty cell in a new workbook filter by index values, tax type, year period, et cetera.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Step two, retrieve values from the existing request. Use df. Get values ex to retrieve values from the selected request ids. List the range names from which to extract the information. The process to get the range names themselves were covered earlier in the presentation.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Df. Get values ex allows multiple requests to be processed at the same time. Df. Get values only processes one request at a time. The process to get the range names themselves were covered earlier in the presentation.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This example lists the range names as outlined and the request ids listed across the top. This result is a consistent and convenient layout of values by range Names and request ID. Create the new request as if you were rolling forward the request. For example, if rolling forward 2013 to 2014, make sure all of the index values are the same as the existing request, except for the year. Use the df Create Request function to create new requests. Dataflow add-in must be installed.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">List index values of the new request. Each df Create request function creates one request. List out df create requests with all the range names listed out as seen in the outlined cells and the insert. Remember that one df Create request function results in a single new request. That&#39;s why there are multiple requests. When the functions are entered correctly, cell value will show ready to run.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the workbook. Select Add-ins dataflow Create New Request log into ONESOURCE. If prompted, all the df Create request functions will be replaced with the new request ID. This is important for the following steps. Step Four push values to the new request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Df. Put values can be used to push multiple range names into the new request. Use the mapping template to list new range names if values need to be moved to new fields from the old request to the new request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Df put values put values from the old request to the new request listed out are the new request ids outlined in the range names for where to push the values after populating the workbook with the df put values functions and the values to be pushed into the new range names. Select Add-ins dataflow. Send data to.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Server. The function will be replaced with the timestamp. In summary, we have learned about dataflow batch processing, which allows multiple requests to be processed automatically. Roll forward. Wizard that is available to row requests from period to period and roll forward, which can be done manually using the dataflow. Add-in.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We encourage you to visit the knowledge base to access various documents such as online guides, templates and product release information.

This course will begin with the various menu selections and move into the Range Name Report, Range Name Cross reference, and finally the diagnostic report.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This section will cover the mini selection. We will cover the menu, range, Name report. Range name, Cross reference diagnostic Report and how to remove report. Flow Designer has several helpful report tools to assist with diagnostics and with extracting data from the repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Select Form Slow Designer from excel&#39;s Add-ins tab to save the list of. The Range Name Report creates another tab for each tab, with rpt as a prefix to the tab name. The new tab shows all the named ranges on that tab.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Range Name Cross Reference Report adds a tab which lists all of the named ranges. Their reference and the value. Diagnostic report. Any issues that will prevent you. The menu I&#39;ve seen here also contains a command to remove all of the reports at once. Notice.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This next section. We&#39;ll look at the Range Name report. We will talk about how to copy every tab. Review input cells. The Range Name Report copies every tab of the workbook and gives it the same name with the prefix of rpt.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It also copies all of the fields on each tab and displays the range names for each input field. Because it displays all of the range names, you can use this report to verify that the input cells all have a range name.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In this example. As shown with the Red arrow, the title field does not have a range name. You can select the General Information Tab and add arrangement. This report is also a helpful tool to review a sign range name.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The range names are needed when you are building linked workbooks using the dataflow add- in or when you need to verify the range names. To build a mapping template for. In this next section we will discuss Range Name cross reference. This includes listing all range names.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The excel Name Manager deleting selected range names, Rebuilding range names, and.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Range Name Cross Reference Report adds an additional tab at the end of the worksheet. The tab named rpt Cross Reference List All range names, the cell reference for the range, and any enter value.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Range Name cross reference is similar to excel&#39;s Name Manager, which also lists the range name, cell reference, and any entered values. Open Name Manager from the excel formulas tab or by pressing CTRL.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excel Name Manager has some nice features, such as the ability to sort by clicking a column header, or to multi Select Range Names. You can use Name Manager to edit the range name or cell reference, or also to delete rating the Range Name cross reference can be used to delete.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Or rename. Multiple Range names. Some implementers use it to name ranges because they can copy and paste similar range names. In this example. The I underscore xxx range names were automatically. If you wish to delete or rename multiple range names, you can highlight them on the Range Name cross reference, and then select delete selected range names from the FormsFlow Designer Add-in menu.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The range names remain on the rpt Cross Reference tab, but have been deleted from the Name manager. Using excel&#39;s Copy and paste functionality, you can create more meaningful range names and copy them down.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Refilled range Names will save the new range names and Name manager. When you look at the name box for those fields, you will see the new range name. Notice the red box area here. Like the Range Name Report, the Range Name cross reference is also helpful when building linked workbooks or extractions. We recommend saving a copy of the workbook with these two reports added as a reference tool.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this section, we will focus on the diagnostic report. The diagnostic report checks for errors that would prevent you from protecting the workbook. It runs diagnostics on every tab in the workbook.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A diagnostics box opens, listing the worksheet name, cell reference, and a diagnostic error for any issues encountered. Clicking the report button adds the report to the workbook. After clicking the Report button, a tab named preconversion Error Report is added to the workbook.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the worksheet name, cell, Reference and Error. A link to the cell seen here in the blue text. Is also provided. The hashtag. Pound ref or Invalid cell reference error occurs when the cell is deleted, but the range name isn&#39;t name manager has arranged name but doesn&#39;t have a valid cell reference.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">French names without a valid cell reference must be deleted. Use excel Name manager to delete the range name. Multiple range names for the same cell reference have to be deleted. Use the excel Name Manager to delete the extraneous Range names, or from the FormsFlow Designer menu. Select Delete Selected Range names.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can click the Refers to column header to sort the range names by the cell reference. If a cell has no name displays, it indicates a cell marked for input which does not have a range name. All cells marked for input must have arranged name assigned. If the cell is not an input cell, change the format so that it is not the color selected for input cells. Otherwise, name the range.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use the reference link in the preconversion error report to access a cell and add a range name. Remember to use remove reports after all diagnostics are cleared. The link is seen here in the blue text.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In summary, you learned how FormsFlow Designer provides various reports that aid in reviewing and modifying your workbook. Also, the Range Name Report and Range Name cross reference are helpful tools for building extractions. The diagnostic report helps correct issues that will prevent you from protecting the workbook and the remove reports in the new selection will clear all of the report tabs at once.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We encourage you to visit the knowledge base to access various documents such as online guides, templates and product release information.

You will also be able to use reports to simplify the design process and protect the template throughout.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The course of this session, we will cover the necessary steps for preparing a form slow workbook. We will discuss name ranges, how to use predefined range names, use runtime functions, and set runtime options. We will also talk about how to use reports and how to protect a work. This first section.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Will look at the various options for creating range names in the workbook, such as the excel Name box. The FormsFlow Designer Option wildcard Range Name, Block Range name and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">repeating cell name. We then look at how to add tankles, automatically create cell names and remove automatic cell name recall from the introduction to Form Slow Designer Web seminar. That the simplest way to create.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A range name is to use excel&#39;s Name Box Start by highlighting the cells and the cells will be outlined in black. Type A name in the name box and press Enter. If you do not press enter. The name will not be.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Also remember that you can click the drop down in the name box to see a list of saved range names. Oftentimes, the info cells needed for a workbook or multiple rows or multiple columns. Form Slow Designer provides four options for naming ranges with multiple cells. Both cards block repeating and table.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wildcard range names are helpful when you have multiple rows that may vary from one request to another. While a block range name is great if you wish to upload the data and always extract the entire block, such as Trial Balance information.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Repeating range names are not used very often, but can be multiple rows and columns. A table allows unique extractions of specific records. Now let&#39;s take a close. Wildcard range names are assigned to two or more rows and can be assigned to a single column or multiple cells merged into a single field. This option is frequently used when the number of records will vary and the fields will be set up as an ad rose group.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cells can either be protected cells. Cells marked for input from providers. Cells containing data pulled from linked workbooks or cells containing. To assign the Wildcard Range name hide by two or more rows in a single column. Remember, they can be sales merched into one field from the Forms Flood Designer Menu Select Cell Names Assign wildcar Range Name the Range selection, then populates based on the cells highlighted into a Range name.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Base and click OK. The Wildcard Range names have four save options and one performance option. The safe options are radio buttons, and you must select one option. The performance option is a checkbox and can either be enabled or disabled. FormsFlow Designer remembers which selections you last used and sets those as D. The first of the Wildcard range names is the no Save option used to load data at runtime, such as information from Linked requests. The data will.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Update each time the request is open, but this information does not need to be saved to the repository because it is already saved in another request. Save input saves the data entered by a data provider.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Save calcs saves the values calculated by excel formulas. The formulas are part of the workbook and will execute when the request is opened, but the values may change. Save all save those entered data and values calculated by formulas, and the Non Empty Performance option specifies for their disabled empty cells while marking this option increases performance. It can also.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here is an example of Wildcard range names saved with the Not Empty Performance option marked. When you extract the fields, the values slide over to fill in the empty spaces and with address information, it isn&#39;t too hard to read.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, this is what happens when the information is displayed in numerical values. You really can&#39;t tell to which field the data belongs, and because of this, the type of data should be considered when deciding whether to Mark the not empty performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Remember that Wildcard range names are typically used with add rows, groups, and are limited to 9999 records. A Wildcard Range Name will display in Name Manager as the Range Name Face question Mark options.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can see several examples of this in this image. The question Mark will be replaced with numbers. One through 9999 as needed to create a unique. An alternative method of assigning a Wildcard range name is to create a word document listing the eight possible extensions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Highlight the fields, and enter the range Namebase in the name box.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then copy the desired extension from the word document and paste it after the range name base. Remember that you must press Enter to save. A block range name is used for input cells only. The cells cannot contain calculations. It is used with multiple rows and columns and is recommended when you have more than 2000.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rows as it saves and extracts much faster than a large number of Wildcard records because the entire block of information is fade and extracted as one field. A block range name is the most common way to upload.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trial. The main disadvantage of a block range name is that it can be difficult to create. You must highlight the entire input area. You would need to highlight the group of cells to apply the fill color, so ideally you should assign the block range name at that time.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Select FormsFlow Designer Cell Names. Assign Block Range Name, then enter the Range name. Base. A Block Range Name Displays as the Range namebase. Block. S. Mentioned previously. A Block range name is the most commonly used option for trial balance information.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The df Put block function can be used to load information into a block range name, while the df git block function can be used to extract the information. In a linked workbook, the DataFlow functions are covered in more depth in the Web seminars, Introduction to DataFlow extraction and using the data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The repeating cell name is used for input cells only, and it can be used with multiple columns and multiple rows. The FormsFlow designer appendumerical suffix to the entered cell name, similar to a range name, base.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This option is older and isn&#39;t as efficient as Wildcard Range name, which is the recommended method. However. Remember that Wildcard range names are limited to one column. Repeating cell name can be used when you have fields in multiple columns, but be aware that it can be a challenge to extract. If you look in the Refers to column on Name Manager you will see that FormsFlow Designer assigns the numerical suffix to each row in a column before moving to the next column. If you format this as an ad rows.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Group the numbering. Because of the difficulty in finding the range name for a specific cell, repeating cell name isn&#39;t used very often. If you decide to use this feature, highlight the group of cells to be named Select Forms, Flow Designer Cell Names assign repeating cell name, then enter the cell name.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In starting value and click. The Add table option supports future DataFlow enhancements as tubular Data is a collection of like items with common properties. The system will store this type of data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a more efficient manner, thereby improving performance and design options for data collection and communication. Create the table in the workbook and format the cells with the input field color. You can add column headers later and you may need to use.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After the table is created, Select FormsFlow Designer Cell Names Add table. After the table has been added, enter a Table Name base. You may also wish to reference the tab or worksheet name here. Either type in the cell references for the Table Range Start and Table Range End, or click the icon in each box to select the cells from the worksheet. The Table Range Start is the first column.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Header the table range in is the cell below the last row of input cell. As seen in excel Name Manager, the Table Range Start and Table Range n references are saved as range names. Similar to a block Range name. The entire table is saved and can be retrieved as one range. However.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table extraction also uses the column headers to filter the results. Future functionality for tables will include the ability to load information into the table. Remember that the dft blend underscore field must be placed in the last column of the table, one row below the last row of.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A table can also be created using the excel Name Box. To do so, enter Dftbl underscore Table Name base and the first header field. Then enter dft blend underscore Table Name base. In the last column, one row below the last input cell. In this example.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The table end is in cell. Ai one. The table can have both column and row headers included. Although the header cells are not formatted with the filled color for input cells, they are safe with the Table information.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As mentioned earlier. One of the unique features of a Table is the ability to extract information for all tables or specific tables for a list of Request IDs. If you specify a column name and column value.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The extracted results will be only those that match, but if you leave those parameters blank, the extraction function will return all record. Here we have an example of the function argument screen for the df get table.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The only required parameters are the request ID list range and the output range. As mentioned before, the extraction functions are covered in depth and the DataFlow Extraction Web seminars. We automatically create cell names feature can be used to speed up the design of the workbook, especially if your range names will be similar.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The feature assigns a unique name to all unnamed input cells in the workbook. It starts on the first tab of the workbook and moves through each worksheet. Assigning a generic range name of I underscore XXX.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where XXX. Is an incremental number only the cells formatted as input cells will be assigned a name. Create your input cells and format them with the Fill color selected for input cells from the FormsFlow Designer menu. Select Cell Name automatically. Create Cell names.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After. You have assigned the generic range names. You will likely want to update them to more specific range names for purposes of extracting the data. The Range Name Cross Reference Report adds a tab similar to excel Name Manager, which allows you to modify the range names. These steps were covered in the introduction to farm&#39;s Flow Designer Web semin.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seminar here&#39;s. A brief review. Highlight the names on the rpt Cross Reference tab. Select Delete Selected range names from the menu. Then modify the range Names and Select Rebuild Range names. This screen displays an example of the Range Name cross reference. When you highlight the generic range names and Select Delete selected range names, it removes the range names from the Name Manager. When you modify the range names and Select Rebuild Range Names, it&#39;s towards the new Range Names in Name Manager, adding the Range name.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cross Reference allows you to use excel&#39;s Copy and paste functionality to update the range names. Automatically create cell names can be used to quickly assign range names to all input cells for the purpose of protecting and testing the workbook. Once you finish the test, you can Select Remove Automatic cell names to clear all of the generic names. Any range names you have modified, and any that you created with other methods are not.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Affected. In this section we will discuss using predefined range names. The predefined range names are listed in the online guide and are used to identify the request. We will then cover</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">how to populate at runtime, how to view the document properties, and how to utilize the diagnostics OK feature.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you create a request, you must specify an entity, a text type. The year and period the entity name an entity ID are set up in either entity browser or entity manager. Remember that the subject of a request can be something other than an entity. It is simply the topic of the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tax types are created in workflow Manager and are used to associate the request with the FileRoom drawer. The year and period are also set up in workflow Manager jurisdiction codes and scenario. Are the optional identifiers when creating a request. There are eight identifiers used to create a unique instance of the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jurisdictions and codes are set up in workflow Manager while the scenario is a free form field, which can be populated with anything at the time the request is created. The predefined range names are often included as none editable fields in the workbook, allowing for the data provider to verify the entity. The field will then populate at runtime when the request is opened.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The predefined Range names can also be viewed in the workbook on Advanced Document Properties. To view the Properties, click the Office button in the top left corner, then Select Prepare and properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Selecting properties from the Office menu expands an area above the Formula bar. With that open, click Document Properties and Select Advanced Properties from the drop down. The Custom tab of Advanced Properties will list information about the workbook, including the predefined range names. This particular screen is from a workbook that has not yet been protected, so it shows design properties such as the input color and the runtime options, which we will discuss in a subsequent section.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostics okay is a predefined range name that can be used to prevent the data provider from marking a request as complete. If you wish to use this feature, the range name must be entered correctly. For example, diagnostics okay, Capital D.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I A G, N O S T I C S Capital O capital K remember that case sensitivity is important for the predefined range names and there are various methods for creating the diagnostic checks. Excel if statements are often used.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this example. A number of if statements are used for the desired diagnostic checks and will return a value of one if there is an error requiring the data provider&#39;s attention. A subtotal of the diagnostic check values has a range name of diagnostics issues, then another if statement in the cell name diagnostics okay returns a value of zero if there are any diagnostic issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostics. Okay. Must equal one for the data provider to Mark the request. Complete. Diagnostics okay only prevents the data provider from marking the request complete. However, other licensed Windsor users can select the status, even if diagnostics okay equals zero. Also, the specific status controlled by this option is the one marked Complete in Status template, regardless of what the status is named.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our next topic will be the use of runtime functions. We will start with an overview, then cover hide, row, hide, column, hide sheet, and look at an example of these. Usually within the FormsFlow template file. There is information that is passed from the ONESOURCE data repository to the spreadsheet, such as DataFlow Request ID. The template file needs the information to run calculations, extractions, et. Cetera. However, the data provider does not need to see this information.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These three runtime functions are available to use to hide the data that the providers do not need to see. Hide rows, hide columns, and hide sheets. Hide row uses parameters to specify</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the worksheet name, the row number, and a hide flag. A hide flag of true indicates the row should be hidden. Excel if statements can be used to generate the true or false value.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since the hide functions execute at runtime, you will see the word stub displayed in the workbook during the design process. After the data provider opens the dataflow request, the function will execute and hide the row, as indicated.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hide column also uses three parameters. The worksheet name, the column number, and the hide flag. Here is another example. Again, these are runtime functions, so the workbook will display the word stub. When the data provider opens the dataflow request, the function will execute and hide the column as indicated.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hide sheet only uses two parameters, the worksheet name and the hide flag. This is an example of the high sheet function. Remember the word stub displays when the function is set up. When the data provider opens the dataflow request, the sheet will hide.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In this example, we see each of the three functions execute at runtime. Row ten, column C, and worksheet underscore runtime are hidden. This next section will cover the set runtime options that are available. These include switches, tabs, runtime options, traffic, cell saves and error messages.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The runtime options are switches that control which menu items are available to the data providers when they open the dataflow request. The switches are specific to this workbook, but will apply to all users when they open the request. Select runtime options from the FormsFlow Designer menu.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The runtime option screen that Opens is called switches and has four tabs. The tabs on the Switched screen consists of the Menu tab that controls the options available to the data provider on the Form Slow Drop down menu, the toolbar tab controls the options available to the data provider on the Form Slow toolbar. The other tab has one option.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Traffic cell saves and the error messages tab suppresses the dataflow errors. The menu and toolbar tabs have identical options and are often set the same to save data option saves the information entered by the data provider, while the load data option loads information from the repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is used with Linked Request to refresh the information that loaded at runtime. The Clear Data option removes all of the information entered in the workbook. This option should be marked with caution or not marked if the request is populated by multiple providers.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The format options, duplicate page, add rows and fit text should be enabled if those features have been added to the workbook. The data provider will not be able to apply the formatting if the menu option isn&#39;t available.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The print option allows the data provider to print the workbook. Local Options allows data providers to save the workbook locally, work offline, and then save the data to the repository. This can be helpful.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multiple people might update the same. When the data provider opens the request, the Farm Flow Drop Down menu and toolbar selections display on the Add-ins tab. In this image, the DataFlow inFormsFlow designer. Add-ins are also displayed. A data provider who is also a form slow designer or creates extraction workbooks, will have these Add-ins installed.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A user who is strictly a data provider will not have those add-ins and will only have the options specified on the runtime options. Traffic self saves should be marked on every workbook because with this option marked if the data provider selects the excel Save icon or menu selection, the DataFlow Safe screen will open instead.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Error Messages tab allows you to suppress DataFlow errors. It can be used to troubleshoot errors. It is generally used only when support suggested. In this next section we will discuss how to use reports. This will include range name reports, range name, cross reference diagnostic reports, many of the common errors, and how to remove the reports.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The brain to name report duplicates all of the worksheets in the workbook, including all the fields and information. The duplicated tab has a worksheet name with rpt. As a prefix. The range names are displayed in Red font, then Select FormsFlow Designer Range Name report.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These tables should visually assist you to ensure all input cells have the appropriate range names assigned. The Range Name Cross Reference Report adds a tab called rtt Cross Reference similar to excel Name Manager. This tab lists all of the range names to Cell Reference and any entered values.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The diagnostic report, evaluates the entire workbook, and list any errors that will prevent protecting the workbook. Select diagnostic Report from the Form Slow Designer menu, and click the Report button to add a tab to the workbook.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This added tab is named preconversion Error Report and includes a hyperlink to access the cell with the error. A hashtag ref error indicates the cell reference is Invalid and it may have been deleted or edited. These range names should be deleted.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An input cell can only have one range name assigned if there are multiple names. Delete the extras. Another error is still has no name. This occurs because all input cells must have a range name. It can be resolved by adding a range name to the cell.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After the errors are corrected, the reports can be removed by selecting Remove Reports from the FormsFlow Designer menu. In this last section, we will cover how to protect the workbook. We will learn how to protect and unprotect forms and Mark as FormsFlow template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The protect form is used to finalize the workbook. This protects the workbook. Unlocks the input cells and removes the grid lines and headings. If all of the errors are corrected, the protection dialog will open.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This screen allows you to select the method of navigation. Select Unlock Cells allows the data provider to select only the input cells, and the tab key can be used to move through the fields. If you have an instructions, tab or hyperlinks, they won&#39;t be able to access those if you Mark Select Unlock Cells. Therefore, no restrictions is more commonly used.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As it allows data providers to access any cell. The unprotect form reverses the Protect form actions and allows you to continue to edit the workbook. The Markass FormsFlow template is an optional method of finalizing the workbook. This option instructs the runtime engine to operate when the request is open and typically used to quickly test or demo a workbook unmark as FormsFlow template will allow further edits to the workbook.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In summary, we learned how to use excel in Formsflow Designer to create range names for all input fields. Use the predefined range names to populate the entity information and use diagnostics OK to prevent providers from closing an incomplete DataFlow request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Be sure to set runtime options to control the data provider options. Use reports to troubleshoot errors, and finally protect the template. We encourage you to visit the knowledge base to access various documents such as online guides, templates and product release information.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition, you can access the ONESOURCE Product Assistance website where you will find many additional Help resources, as well as access to our customer Email support. Winford University is our learning management system that empowers you to control your professional development.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dataflow Extraction Classic - Linking Requests &amp; Roll Forward:</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hello and welcome to dataflow extraction linking requests and roll forward. Upon completion of this module, participants will be able to recall that extraction functions can be used in template design. Explain how the Role Forward Wizard works. Apply the automated Roll forward option. Explain how to use the alternate manual Roll forward method.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the module, we will walk through DataFlow extraction functions used in template design. Next, we&#39;ll discuss the three options for Roll Forward. We will learn how to access the Role Forward wizard and how to use it.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then we will discuss how to apply the automated role forward within the FormsFlow template setup. Finally, we will discuss the alternate manual method of rolling data forward, including options of how to set it up.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linking dataflow requests allows you to add extraction functions within the FormsFlow enabled template that will query the database without using the DataFlow add-in when set up properly. This allows the request to access data directly from another dataflow request when it is open.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An example of how this functionality might be used is prior period balances. A DataFlow request would be created. And completed for one period, and when the next period comes, new requests using the same template would be created.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Extraction formulas can be added within the template that needed to pull the prior period data directly into the request. The linking formulas would be configured to get whatever data is currently saved in the database for the prior period. Only certain functions will work within a request to pull data as the request is open.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The functions that can run within the FormsFlow template are dfget. Id dfgetlist dfgettable dfget block DF get values DF getvalues ex DF load Wildcard DF load range, and DF wildcard table just like using the dataflow extraction.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Functions in an excel workbook for reporting a request. Id is required to pull data with an extraction function using request linking functionality. The output range in the function arguments must also be in input or unlocked cells, so data can populate into the request. As a best practice, it is recommended you place the linking functions and output ranges in it in columns so the data providers won&#39;t be able to modify them. Next, we will discuss the different role forward options offered in DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In dataflow there are three options for rolling forward data between periods or years. The Roll Forward wizard simplifies the process of rolling forward DataFlow requests using a six step process within the DataFlow Actions menu. Part of the process includes populating, a mapping template that will be used during.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Roll forward process as well as for future periods. Another option is to automate the Roll Forward wizard by setting up the Role Forward parameters in the Role Forward tab. In the FormsFlow template Setup area, the alternate manual roll forward process utilizes DataFlow extraction functions to step through the process.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of retrieving data from existing requests, creating the next period requests and pushing the retrieve data to the new requests. The Roll Forward wizard process is one who are more requests at one time and executes overnight once the six step process is complete. To access this Roll Forward method, you will first choose.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The requests that you wish to roll forward in the dataflow grid and Select Roll Forward requests from the Actions menu. The six step process will follow step One, specify text type and template. You can change the text type or template if you wish to roll forward to new request with a different tax type or template.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The application will require you to create a mapping template that will roll forward data such as Prime. Year balances the mapping template is an excel file that contains a source column and a destination column. The file tells the system the fields to pull data from the source in the existing DataFlow request to push data to the destination. In the newly created dataflow requests, one roll forward is executed.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even if no data is being rolled forward, and you would simply like to create new requests. Using Roll Forward, a mapping template must still be created and validated, which can be blank. Step Two specify index values.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Index values include new request values such as year period, jurisdiction codes, and scenario. At least one index value must change to make the request unique as a duplicate request cannot be created. Step Three Due Date Selection Select from three options that allow for assigning the appropriate due date for the new requests. Step Four Other options choose whether to include Notes and docum.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Documents in a row. Forward Step five assign users and notify select from three options for assigning users, including whether to notify them by email. Step Six, confirm and notify. Allows you the ability for further notification, and then allows you to Select Finish to complete the Role Forward steps. Now let&#39;s look at how we can automate the Role Forward process further by setting it up with the FormsFlow template. Utilizing the Automated Roll Forward option, requires an administrator to set up the Rule forward parame.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Parameters discussed in the Role Forward wizard within the Role Forward Tab of the form&#39;s Flow Template setup. Setting up the Roll Forward this way allows users to roll forward requests without having to go through the six step process, including creating the mapping template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because they would have already set up the Role forward and loaded a mapping template. This method also allows administrators to give users and or groups of users the ability to roll forward their requests on their own. As with the Roll Forward wizard option, this method also processes overnight to access the automated roll forward setup and administrator will choose the setup menu on the left side of the screen below the filters for the DataFlow grid. The Roll Forward Tab is within the form&#39;s Flow templates menu of the template you wish to choose to set up within the Roll Forward tab, you will find the same parameters we discussed in the Roll Forward Wizard.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These parameter options include designating a tax type and template, and uploading a mapping template that includes source and destination fields to roll forward. It also includes choosing a New Year and or period and whether to keep or change the jurisdiction codes and scenario assigned to the requests. You will also have options for due date components such as documents and user assignments.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once these are configured, you will check the Enable Default Role Forward Settings Channel checkbox, and Select Save with this setup. When you choose the Roll Forward Requests option from the Actions menu in the dataflow Grid, you will only see the last step, which includes additional notifications for the Roll forward.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Next, let&#39;s look at an alternative way we can roll data forward in DataFlow. The final roll forward option in dataflow has a more manual setup, but is sometimes the preferred method. Manual Roll Forward utilizes specific extdf functions in excel as an alternate approach to rolling forward DataFlow requests. This method requires the setup and use of DataFlow functions, but it is immediate and does not require any wait time. Like the Overnight Roll Forward wizard and Automated Roll Forward setup.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The first step is to retrieve a list of requests that need to be rolled forward using the Extds Get List function and Get menu option in the Data extraction menu of the Add-in. Next, identify the fields and retrieve the values that you will need to send to the new requests using Extdfget</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">functions and the Get menu option in the Data extraction menu of the Add-in with this step, you will use the appropriate DataFlow functions depending on the range name method. The values are in.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For instance. Extdf get values for excel Range Names Extdf Get block for Block Range names extdf. Load wildcard for wildcard Ranges, etc. Then create the new request you wish to roll data to with Extdf, Create request and the Create menu option in the DataFlow at in once.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The requests are created. The request ids for the newly created requests appears where the function was run in excel. Finally, you will send the data into the new requests created with the Extdf Create request function. The newly created request ids are used to load the previously query data into the new request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Requests using extdfit functions. While this method does require slightly more initial setup, once it is set up, the work is complete and you can make changes and utilize it whenever you need to roll forward. This method is usually preferred when a roll forward needs to happen in real time.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And waiting on the overnight process is not practical. During the module, we walk through using dataflow extraction functions in template designed to link requests. Next, we discuss the three options for roll forward and how to access and use the Role Forward wizard. Then we discussed how to apply the automated Role forward within the FormsFlow template setup to simplify the roll forward for the users. Finally, we introduced the alternate manual method of rolling data forward, including options of how it can be set up.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FormsFlow Designer Classic - Reports &amp; Templates:</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hello and welcome to Forms, Flow, Designer Reports and template creation. Upon completion of this module, participants will be able to identify reports and their purpose. Explain runtime options, and how to configure them. Apply how to protect and unprotect the template for editing. Explain the process of creating DataFlow requests from the converted template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the module, we will walk through the forms, flow, designer reports, and how to use them. Next, we will learn about the runtime options, what each option does, and how to appropriately configure them.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Then we will apply template protection and explore editing the template file. Finally, we will discuss how we will bring the converted file into dataflow to create the form&#39;s flow template, forms, flow template and DataFlow requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First, let&#39;s look at the reports offered in the FormsFlow Designer Add-in. The reports menu section in Template Design provides reporting tools to both evaluate and optimize template performance and diagnose issues with a template that may cause problems in the DataFlow requests. It is encouraged that these reports are run prior to protecting and Loading the template file into DataFlow. The Last Cell report provides designers with an interactive input view into where excel views the last cell versus where the designer believes the last cell is in the template file. The report is provided as a guide to assist the designer in optimizing the template performance if there is a wide gap in where excel views the last cell.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And where the actual design of a template stops, the rows in between should be removed. The diagnostic Report examines the template for areas of concern and provides a listing of any issues with the design of the template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The report contains a column for error message, which is a description of the error, and a column for address which tells the location of the error. Certain diagnostics such as Input has no name should be corrected prior to protecting the workbook and Loading it into dataflow as a FormsFlow template.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evaluate template, examines the template and provides information to improve the template from both the design. And Performance perspective. Entries in this Report appear in a pain at the bottom of the excel view and may or may not need a dressing at the designer&#39;s discretion.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Range Name Report creates another tab that displays all the existing range names and provides a hyperlink for each named cell. This report is helpful to ensure range names are unique and follow plan guidelines and later for determining range names to use in dataflow extraction formulas. The range.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Name Cross Reference Report generates the report on a tab listing all the named ranges, their reference, and the value in that named cell. This report also provides a way to rename many cells at once.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the Fly Out menu, generate report, delete selected range names and rebuild range names are options offered with this report. Generate Report generates the report and will list all the named ranges in the workbook and their reference location.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Delete selected range Names allows you to delete many range names for the template at once by highlighting the range names in the report and selecting this option. This is helpful when a tab or area in the template has been removed, and the range names need to be removed as well, or when you need to rename cells. Rebuild range.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Names allows you to build range names from this report by typing in the Range name. Next to the Range name reference, and then selecting this option. You can also replace Range names that were deleted with new names. Then select this option to give those references and you name Remove Reports will remove any and all reports that were run.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Next, let&#39;s look at the runtime options. Now that the reports had been run and utilized prior to protecting the. Year the runtime. Options allow you to control which menu items data providers will see on the excel menu and FormsFlow Designer Tool bar when they have a request, open.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These selections apply to all data providers. Both. License and nonlicense using this template. To configure runtime options, select the Settings menu icon in the dataflow. Add-in and choose workbook runtime options.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By default, all options are selected and you can deselect items you do not wish data providers to use. It is recommended that you deselect any option that you will not be using as part of your template design.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The menu and toolbar tabs have identical options available and should always be marked the same. Let&#39;s look at what each option does. Save Data allows data providers to save data to the DataFlow repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a best practice, this option should always be checked. If you are requiring data to be entered into the request. Load data pulls data from link templates or the most recently saved data from the DataFlow repository into the request. Be aware the Load data feature will clear the data that was previously loaded for those fields, so this option should be carefully considered.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clear Data allows data providers to clear all data from the active worksheet. This option should be used with caution, as this could include data entered and saved by other data providers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Duplicate page allows data providers to make an exact copy of the Cab. If this feature was designed in the template, most users will not check this option as it is older functionality that is not often used or recommended. Duplicate page should only be marked if that feature was activated in the template.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As part of template design. Print allows data providers to print the request and should usually be marked. Local Options allows data providers to save the workbook locally and work offline to enter data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, when they save the data to the DataFlow repository, their entries will overwrite what others may have entered. This option is not often recommended and should be used with caution if more than one person will update the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The other tab as one available option. Trapxl Saves allows data providers to use the excel Save button to save data to the dataflow repository. With this option, marked The ONESOURCE DataFlows Save dialog opens.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Conversely, if this option is not marked, data providers are forced to save the workbook to their local drive, and they will have to Select Save from the Forms, Flow toolbar or menu to save the data to the repository.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At the risk of losing data, the best practice recommendation is to always Mark this option and have it available to the data providers. Once the runtime options are configured, you are now ready to protect the template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Converting the workbook to a FormsFlow template via the Protect Menu option is the final step before Loading the template into dataflow and creating requests. Once the workbook is converted using the Protect Menu option, the input cells or any unlocked cells will be the only cells available to enter data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All other cells will be read only and the user will not be able to make edits to them. To protect the template, you will simply Select Protect in the template Design menu. If the Protect menu option is disabled, ensure that the workbook is marked as a FormsFlow template with the menu option of Mark FormsFlow in template design.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A dialog box will appear, prompting the user to run the diagnostic report. If you have already run the report, you can select no, but errors in the diagnostic report should be reviewed and corrected prior to the template being protected. Next, a dialog box will prompt the user to choose whether to prevent users from selecting locked cells. As mentioned, once the workbook is protected, only input.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cells will be available for data entry. Therefore, allowing users to select locked cells does not give them the ability to edit those cells. This option is navigational, but if there is a lead sheet or any fields the data provider needs to see or access that aren&#39;t input fields, you should Select no to allow users.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ability to navigate freely. In the template design menu, the protect menu will say and protect when the template is protected. When the unprotect menu is selected, the template can be edited. Once changes are complete, it will need to be protected again and saved before Loading the template to DataFlow. Now that the template file is protected and saved.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We can discuss how to create the FormsFlow template in dataflow and load the FormsFlow template. Then dataflow requests can be created and made available to the data providers to enter data. The FormsFlow template setup can only be accessed by an administrator and is within setup in ONESOURCE workflow manager.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To navigate to this area, Select Setup below the filtering options to the left in the dataflow grid. Once in the setup screen, select DataFlow on the left to expand the options. FormsFlow templates is where all the FormsFlow templates will be located once.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They are created and loaded into DataFlow. Here you can search for a template and use the Actions menu to add, edit, delete, or archive a template and view the template history. Next, we will load the template file and set up the template properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To create a new template, select the Actions Menu button, and add template. To complete the FormsFlow Email Template screen, you will choose a template name, optional text type status template, and optional workflow template, and due date in the FormsFlow Source section, you will browse for your protected FormsFlow Template file you saved earlier and enter a description. This description.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Field is helpful for identifying what is included in the loaded template without having to open it, especially as new versions are created. Just below that is the Email Setup area. You can include wording for an initial and reminder email that is sent to the users assigned to the request, and a completion notification that can be sent to a group to let them know the request was marked as complete.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After the template data is entered, be sure to click Save at the top of the screen. A DataFlow request is the combining of the form&#39;s flow template with a specific entity and is assigned to a user or user group for data entry. After the FormsFlow template is set, up, requests can be created.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Select the DataFlow menu in ONESOURCE workflow Manager from the Actions menu, select new dataflow requests. You will be prompted through four steps. Step One, select entity or entities to create requests for Step Two, select the form&#39;s Flow templates and assign tax type, year period, and optional jurisdiction. Step Three assign due date, users or groups, and choose to notify the ones assigned by email and add optional codes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Or scenarios. Step Four Select Finish. The new dataflow requests will appear in the dataflow grid and are ready for data entry by the assigned data providers. Let&#39;s review what we learn during the module. We walked through the form&#39;s Flow Designer reports and how to use them.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We learned about the runtime options, what each option does, and how to appropriately configure them. Then we applied template protection and explored editing the template file. Finally, we discussed how to bring the converted file into dataflow to create the form&#39;s flow template forms, flow template and dataflow requests.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Next Generation of Data Collection in ONESOURCE DataFlow:</h1><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You understand the next generation of application. The value that it brings for you, the user experience around it, and the improvements they have made. So let&#39;s look at. The agenda so we can structure ourselves for the call.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I&#39;m going to start with what is ONESOURCE DataFlow. I&#39;m going to give you a quick overview for those of us who are not current users of this application, I think it will be helpful. For you to see what DataFlow can do for you and the problems it can solve.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then I&#39;m going to go ahead and do a comparison on things that are similar with classic and changes. And I&#39;m going to talk a little bit about apis, and then we go into the product demo. Then I&#39;ll come back and wrap it up by talking about the conversion summary in the middle. Now.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay. So. Let&#39;s get started. What is ONESOURCE DataFlow so ONESOURCE DataFlow helps standardize, organize. And optimize your data at every step. It is an excel based application.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You have the ability to take your current excel tax package and then convert it into Web based.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet excel DataFlow templates. And then. You can securely send them to all your data providers and ask them to populate it with the data that you need. All of this data is stored federally. And you can now use this data to do more calculations in that work paper. Or you can leverage it across other source applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So this is a simplistic view of what is DataFlow. Let&#39;s talk a little bit about. Why dataflow. How all of this helps you. So if you&#39;re not using a tool like dataflow. I can imagine the process for collecting information from various individuals spread around the world. For many of our organizations, even in the same city, though now with the new environment that we are in, we&#39;re all working remotely. So to be able to collect all of this data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a standard format. You&#39;re using excel. That you&#39;re sending. Via Outlook and keeping track of the latest copy. All of this. Leads to. Just. A lot of room for error. It makes things redundant because nobody&#39;s sure what another one is working on to lead to some double work.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It increases inaccuracies again the risk of. Someone overriding something if it is in a shared network drive, for instance, is high, because you are not sure who&#39;s working on what right now. Not to mention.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is a lack of visibility that comes with it because again, everything is spirit. People are working in their own version of this excel book that now that you guys are passing around. So. It creates chance of errors. Just go up tremendously when you&#39;re working in this type of format.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other things. We have heard people talk about it. Just create inconsistencies. There are unauthorized changes, and. There isn&#39;t a standard way of getting all of the data. So everybody is working in their own fashion sometimes and that leads to someone else having to put it all together.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And make it bring in the same format. So it makes sense. And then, of course. Reporting can be a complete nightmare. Which you want to find out where everybody&#39;s at and. Everything is so decentralized.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Can you imagine it&#39;d be hard to know exactly what&#39;s going on and how much further anybody has reached. So with all that. It&#39;s time for our first poll question. So the way calling will work is you will be able to answer this question that I&#39;m about to ask you using the Q and A panel, and I&#39;m going to give you 30 seconds to answer the question after.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I read the question. So the first question I want to ask is, what tool do you currently use to collect data. Your options are sell. An Outlook, which is option One. Option two is shared network drive.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Option three is DataFlow, and your option. Four is other and if you&#39;re choosing other, I would love to hear what tool you&#39;re using to do this today. I&#39;m going to give you 30 seconds. Starting now. Again, the question I&#39;m asking is what tool do you currently use to collect data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use, excel and outlook. I shared network drive, DataFlow or. Okay, now it&#39;s about 30 seconds. So I hope you had a chance to answer that question for me. Let&#39;s move on. To our next slide. So since I just talked about.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The chaos it can be is about having the centralized tool like DataFlow. I want to quickly just summarize what airflow can do for you. DataFlow will allow you to easily consolidate aggregate information from around the globe. It will help you create standards that it will allow you to do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With security around things and the access control. So not everybody is overriding the work and you can set up correct roles and responsibilities so you know which user is working on. What particular workpaper? All of a sudden.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the bottom line, creating harmony in your process. Okay. So now that we&#39;ve talked about DataFlow in general, let&#39;s talk about the next generation of DataFlow, particularly what&#39;s new with the next Gen. So the first thing I want to talk about is the enhanced performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So with the next generation of DataFlow, we were able to optimize some of the way methods in which you store your data. Namely your Table, for instance, Sales ranges. And that leads to better performance for you when you&#39;re trying to extract information or narrow down to.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A certain specific number. In addition, we were also able to change how we put your request together. So currently in your classic application. The request when we open a request for you, we make several steps back and forth to the server to get the information for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whereas the next generation. All at once. So we&#39;re putting the request together in one trip to the server and then open it up for you. And the term for this is called server side processing, and we find that that leads to approximately ten to 15% performance with bonus and huge for some big tablets.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, of course, the size of your template. The network that you&#39;re using it on. And how your template was written. How much optimized that template is. You&#39;re always. The biggest factor when it comes to performance in DataFlow, but this should definitely help give it a boost.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The second item I want to talk about is api access, so the next generation of dataflow is api enabled. This means. We now have tiny little addresses for all the data that is stored within DataFlow. This allows you to access this data outside of your upload much easily and then you can create custom dashboards, create custom reports using this data that is stored within DataFlow now so apis allow you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To do all of that and more. The third item I want to talk about is the centralized Platform services. So the next generation of DataFlow is on the centralized platform. And I will show you in just a minute. What I mean by that.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s basically going to be using the common entities the new user administration which every next generation application of consortium is moving to use allowing to have a more cohesive. Seamless experience for your users and yourself.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is also browser agnostic. I know this is a big one, so going forward in the next generation of DataFlow you are not type two I. E. Only. You can use any browser of your choice. And Lastly. It is also globalized and cloud based.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Okay. So now that we have talked about what&#39;s new in DataFlow, let&#39;s take a look at what. Still has common with our classic DataFlow. So functional reason features that are already solving your biggest problems.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Continue to stay in the next generation of DataFlow outflow Request Management your ability to design templates and manage. Them. The flexibility around template design is all going to remain. The saras and action management features which allow you to automate things will also remain so I&#39;m not going to read through the list. You can look at that on the slide here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But I do want to call out that client manager has a little asterisk next to it. That&#39;s because if you&#39;re using the next generation DataFlow right now and are affirm, the client manager functionality is not yet enabled. That comes out really soon.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay. Let&#39;s go take a look at our key features. Comparison to classic. Next generation of DataFlow like I already talked about is browser agnostic. And by that I mean you can use any browser of your choice.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Scroll this per email. It is centralized. Sorry. It&#39;s integrated with the central entities and jurisdictions and tax sites. It uses the next generation of document management system, and because it has api, it is api enabled. It allows you to create custom dashboards and create your own.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Report out of data. I talked about the fact that you optimize the table and range structures. This along with the server side processing that I talked about where we put the request together.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Before we open it for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Versus making trips back and forth like we do in Classic. So the optimized table and rate structure along with server side processing. Leads to better performance for you. And I hope you guys see that right away as you start moving your tablet over.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Extraction is now available. To our add-in of course, as we join the Classic, but also APIs. And then last, but not the least. It has a modern looking feel, which you&#39;ll see in a minute. And then the Extended Language board.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay. Let&#39;s now talk more about APIs. So here is the list of epis that are available to you for dataflow and you can gauge from the list. It allows you to do pretty much everything around the request without having to log into the system. If you choose to do that.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So you can use the tool of your choice and then create your little dashboards outside of websource to visit Recording, and then manage your request. In the next slide. Is listing off which data point you could use in the use cases. So on the left here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you use the request and the template attributes using those APIs. You can update a user assignment overwriter checkout. Pretty much end to end status management. And then you can also create requests and delete them and ask with them.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the right. It is the setup that you have the request data. Api basically lets you see the data within a request, but extracted using apis outside. And you can use that to create custom reporting. So.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the next slide, I have. A custom dashboard. And this is just a sample of what you could do. Using the apis that we have now available, you could create your own view. Of what it looks like right now when it comes to your time process where exactly you are at.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How much is complete. Started. Just putting an error and how many requests you have so that&#39;s what this little view is showing. Okay. Time for another. Polling question. So again, I&#39;m going to read the question. And I&#39;m going to give you 30 seconds to answer the question. You can answer it using the Q and a panel.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So the question is, does your company utilize APIs. Looking for a Yes. No. And it&#39;s okay if you&#39;re not sure. And that&#39;s the third option. Not sure. Time starts now. Okay. The question is, does your company utilize APIs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I hope you were able to answer that question. Again another reminder if you have any questions. For us feel free to use the Q and A panel at any time to ask us those questions. And we&#39;ll be happy to answer those for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All right, now we&#39;re moving to the product demo. So let&#39;s see what we have going on there. Okay. Here we go. So this is the new ones. Where Sachs.com, the next generation of our platform. If you&#39;re not familiar with it.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can see it&#39;s completely. New and improved. The tiles is how you launch applications before I go into DataFlow. I do want to show you a little bit of the administration features. Okay. Grab me. So I&#39;m going to find my user. I can do that.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Using the search functionality. And this is the one open. So you can create your users using the Add User button earlier on the grid, and then you would come to User permissions to manage your permission for the user.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I want to point out a couple of things when it comes to setting up the user for dataflow. Please make sure that you navigate to this platform tab, and actually, before we go here. This administration view is accessible to the admin users only, so this is controlled permission. Not</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">everybody can come in here much like what you&#39;re used to today. But if you&#39;re the admin you would come in here and go to the platform.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Options and then make sure the DataFlow next Gen system group is something that your user is part of. This will ensure that they see the tile. The next thing I want to show you is there you go. Do permissioning for the product DataFlow and let me just call it out. I know you see 20.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By the time you&#39;re using this application. This will go away. This is something that you&#39;re working on updating to. Just show DataFlow right here for you. But now that you&#39;re in DataFlow view, this is where you can manage permissions for your user so you can make them an admin user. And if you check this box by default all these boxes below for access get checked so quick shortcut to making somebody an admin.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you want to not make them an admin, then simply do not check this box and then come in here and select the app. If you want to give that you can customize this access, I&#39;m going to quickly scroll down.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can see various options that are available. Okay. Right here is the data permission area. You only come and toggle this and set something up if you want to restrict access so this user should have access to everything. Just leave this area alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You check this box to make somebody to the provider user. That&#39;s right. So there is no longer a user type called data provider. You will set up them as a regular user and then come in here and check this box. This will limit them to only seeing the DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tile, and then. See the request that they have access to. Okay. One quick thing under documents before we continue. So in order to make sure your user has permission to view at. Documents. Please make sure to check the boxes right here under.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Document. Okay. So this is all about setting up users. Let&#39;s quickly look at the interview. So what you&#39;re looking at right now is the. Anode area, and this is where you would come in. To add your new entities, you click on the Add button and will navigate you to adding an entity. You can then come in here and Mark that entity for DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you click here. Enabled for DataFlow. I could enable it for any other application if I like and then if I did that. It no longer is a day appointed. That&#39;s why. So we don&#39;t leave it at this. Close.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And go back work. Next, I want to show you the place where you go. Look at your jurisdictions. And then right here are your tax types. So let&#39;s look at jurisdiction. And again, just like we did for any, you could select that and then associate the application that you want them to appear in. So for those jurisdictions you want to see within DataFlow, you could come in here and then select the Associate application option and then check DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All right, let&#39;s look at notification. So this is where you would come in and create your notification template. So initial reminder. Sorry. Initial assignment, the reminder and completion enough. You can add more templates if you like.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It would require you to have a template name. Which you will see there&#39;s an improvements compared to classic you can actually format. This body a little bit your email body a little bit. And then also you can put in some variables in here. So these are your options. In this particular example, I use the variable assigned user. Now when I send this completion email.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Out the assigned username will appear here. So few little enhancements that have. Make next Gen. That much better. Okay. This was the Tour My little Quick Tour in administration. Now let&#39;s actually launch the application.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Okay. So right here is what you&#39;re used to for those who are current data for users the dataflow browser. So this would be your equivalent of your github browser, your request grid. But when I want to talk about the request just yet, I want to start again from the setup side. So let&#39;s go to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">setup. Under setup, you will see you have the options to go to Data for templates status, templates list management. This is where you would download the add-in and only those who will be creating templates need this and then you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Need a bolt upLet converter. So let&#39;s go look at dataflow tablets. This is where your list of data for templates look will live. And this is what it looks like. So I&#39;m sure it&#39;s familiar to you. I&#39;m going to open this example.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So you can take a look at what the screen appears as. You still need your template name, status, template. This is where you would upload your template. Check out duration remains a required field. You can set up your initial reminders.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the simulation email. So the emails I just showed you the place where you go set up those templates. This is where you use them. Located for complex history. You can also set up your Role Forward options here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now you would use this. You would set this up if you are going to use your automated row forward slash management, or you have some default go forward settings that you want to set up. Okay, let&#39;s take a look at our.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Status. Oh, before we do that, I want to show you that you could delete your templates and archive them. And again, this is permission that you can manage. And then there are also filters because we know this can get quite long.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Very quickly the list of templates. So you have your filters right here. Okay. Let&#39;s go look at Status templates. All right. So if status templates again, just like. Your Data for template List here&#39;s your list of your satis templates. You can go in and take a look.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What it looks like. Your name is required. You still have the familiar default status, and then the status that means it&#39;s completed. You have the option to set those. In addition to that, you also have the option to set colors for different statuses.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Here are your options. That you can pick from. Again like I talked about data permissions. If you want everybody to be able to come in. And change your request statuses and take all of these actions.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Just leave this area black, but you can use this to sort of manage permissions. Further. So you can decide who has the permission to edit a request in certain status, and who could change it to certain status, using these two areas and using assigned groups as well as users for this.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let me quickly bring my view up for you. Let&#39;s take a look at Action management. Yes, I don&#39;t want to save any changes. So in the Action management. Here are our current options. For those who are not familiar, this basically allows you to set up some action that can happen when your request reaches a certain status so you could update a status, automatically recap the request, send a reminder, email.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And go forward. The Sanctuary and the glm related automation statuses are coming soon. Okay. So now that we have looked at status and action management, let&#39;s go look at our list management. So under list management, you can take a look at your codes and period. If it&#39;s going here and you can add more values, you can move it around.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stitch My solder in which they appear in the drop down list. And then the same goes for period you want to save this time and continue. This here is not a period that I added. You can add more. You can delete.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You get the idea. Okay. Let&#39;s go look at the flow adding now. To do that. I would like to go in here and download a template. So let me show you. This template. Here we go. Okay. So the new add-in is called Data collection.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And it&#39;s called Data collection. It enables you to collect data, but we also wanted to differentiate with the current DataFlow added. And the idea is that. You can have both of them installed at the same time. They don&#39;t conflict with each other, so they&#39;re completely compatible.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This allows you to log in to your instance and. Lead us. This is how you would go around marking your templates. Let me quickly, unprotect. And as I am protect, you can see there are other options available to set up your sales naming so you can under names. You can create tables, ranges.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Automatic Names You can create adro Groups you can create. A cell and make sure. This allows them to attach documents. Your providers attached documents within the request right here allows you to Mark something as a note.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can then protect it so the same function. With the DC add-into but enhance so there was range earlier there&#39;s tables but they have been optimized to just make it faster in the waste or data in the back end has been changed to allow us to capture more information and then present it back to you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Usually. I wanted to quickly show that you can. Set more than one input color. Now it can go up to three. And then if you pick a color that is already filled. In the sheet too. So that&#39;s all I wanted to show about the addict.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Let me quickly, close this. Don&#39;t save any changes. It&#39;s gross. And now let&#39;s go take a look at our request. Okay. So this is our request browser. And. You&#39;re basically able to filter this just like you were earlier. So this is your filter button, right here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can nail things down for a template. So let&#39;s see. Like to narrow down to ocp DataFlow fly and then you&#39;re looking at things just pertaining to that template. If you change it to Income tax. Fly.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s very easy for you to go in and apply filters. And you can do that for status. Your tax type period assigned to Cold scenario and even request source. So this basically tells you if the request was created using an api using site the ui versus go forward for now, but in the future you could be using api to create requests and it will show up here now to turn off the filters.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">You could.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Click the text button here. I like to press this button. Okay. Next thing I want to show is the Show height, column option. So you can decide which column you want to appear in your grid. The list of columns that are available to you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay. Now let&#39;s go ahead and add a request before we explore further. So to add a request, you click on Add request. And then you see the step one would be your list of entries. So let&#39;s begin. Toys.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s my son&#39;s favorite entity. He was watching me set this up because he&#39;s six year old and six year olds. Like toys. Okay. And then let&#39;s do the acme Incorporated Limited. Click next. And then you can pick your.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Or you can pick just one. You can pick your taxpayer. I want to make sure I&#39;m not creating something that already exists. So this may not make sense. To you. As. Logically, but I&#39;m just trying to create a unique request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Business license? Why not. And then we can set up a year. So let&#39;s put the year as. 2022. Let&#39;s be forward looking a little bit. The fear is that the Q three, which is fine. And then I could select a jurisdiction and set that.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To. Just move on. It&#39;s not a risk by deal. I don&#39;t have to. Click next and right here. I have the ability to sort of bulk assign, so I have all these requests. We&#39;re going to the same person. I would just click on assign user right here and then pick who I assign for it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And then same goes for setting the D rate. I could again set the book due date for all of the requests right from here. Or. I could do it one at a time, so I could assign this one. All these requests individually. It&#39;s up to me.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We can pick some code. Engineer. Okay. And then we can just finish some leading reassignments, like on purpose. And finish. Okay. Let&#39;s see, what else can we do? I can then quickly filter to find those requests and then assign them using the assign user option right here. So I&#39;m going to just go to this one. It&#39;s not a site to anybody I&#39;m assigning.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There. And then you see andrew&#39;s name up here so that the sign is him. First you quickly assign them. You can quickly send reminders for your request so you can select request and then do the Send reminder option to send them an email.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay. So I&#39;ll let you know. And see if I can bring it up here. I&#39;m trying not to change screens. Too much to not make you guys dizzy as you watch this recording. All right. The Change Request Status Option allows you to change your request status.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pretty self explanatory, and the options you see here depends on the status template associated with your DataFlow template. You can also edit your properties. So let&#39;s do that. Let&#39;s edit some properties. Such.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Type or. Period I can add a jurisdiction to them. Set up a code. So all those options are available to me. Say like a lot of bulk change their status from right here. Welcome back to all four in just a bit.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But we can also import now, and I want to just let you know that you could actually create requests using import. You could start by just exporting out. And that will let you pretty important. Sorry, that would give you sort of a template to start with and then you can import that right in. So in the current application to create requests, you have to go through the reserve or you have to use.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The. Dc, formulas. To create them, whereas in the next channel, we made it simpler for you to create. Request in bulk using main Port function. So please do give it a try and let us know if you find that useful.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I think I clicked on your sort right there. And then of course there is the Explore functionality for let&#39;s just put your request. I didn&#39;t mean to click it. There is something going on around it so they need to click it, but I welcome you to a try. It will let you explore the request out.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can delete an archived data for request, so why don&#39;t we do that. Let&#39;s take one. Let&#39;s take this one. The trial balance. And. Let&#39;s archive the data for request. Make sure that I really want to go ahead and do it. Click. Ok.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And now that request will be archived. So if I want to see my archive request what do I do. Go back to your filter and you check the Show archived Request option. Apply. And this is where your Archive request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you choose to, you can unarchive it. Sorry I&#39;m here. I&#39;m not quite. But I&#39;m going to leave it as is. I&#39;m going to reset my filters. And then I&#39;m going to turn my folders off. So you notice how when I set my filters.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of my options slide under more and then. As I hide that filter pane. More option two options, which is just the system. The window adjusting to the space it has. That&#39;s why it just puts everything under more so if you&#39;re looking in a smaller screen, you might not see all of these options. Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re all under your.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">More seizure options. Okay. So let&#39;s talk about override. Checkout for those who don&#39;t know. This allows you to override. A checked out request. So when somebody opens a request. It shows here checked out by and that&#39;s basically saying someone else has it. You can open it</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and you only read only format right now. But you can&#39;t make changes because somebody else is making those changes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So again. They&#39;re managing change for you. Not letting. Poor people over at each other, but if you&#39;re the admin you have the option to override the checkout, or if you have the permission to override checkout, you can do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You just check the box and becomes enabled for a checkout request. And then you can go ahead and make changes in it. You can also. Recalculate request researcher preferences, and then look at request history.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So let&#39;s quickly take a look at the request right here. So you can see what that looks like. Sort of captures. What I did, I wrote forwarded, it. Who did it? The time it was done? What did we do. Quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I&#39;m going to roll forward. Request history. Okay, let&#39;s talk role forward now. So to roll forward a request. Obviously choose the Role forward option, but I want to open a request really quickly and put some data on it. So let&#39;s open my son&#39;s favorite one again. The Toys ink.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s see. This is a simple template. And we&#39;ll just make it easier for me to explain the example. If you look at the trial balance, I could put in some numbers here. Code here some description and then put in some amount.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But I set this up as a table. And when I did this, so when I create my mapping template, I&#39;ll make sure that I use the column name. So let&#39;s say I want to set up. Enroll forward. I want to say everything that I&#39;ve put under debits and credits here. I want that to roll forward to my trial balance template through my trial balance sheet under amount.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It would be as simple as simply putting the name of the source and destination. Tables and then putting the name of the columns. So I think it will make much more sense using the mapping template. But before I go and do that, I want to make sure you see.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s actually do this. Let&#39;s unprotect this template really quickly, and I want to make sure you see the name of this. Right here. This is TB table. So that&#39;s the name of. My table on this template and then under provision.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sheet. I have another table called My Provision table. So. If I were to move forward, what would my mapping template look like. Give me 1 second. Let&#39;s pull that up for you. So when I create my mapping template, I will go ahead and make sure I put the source table name, which is Provision Table. So let&#39;s go back and take a look. This is my source table. This is where I want the data to come in. It&#39;s called Provisions underscore Table. So I would go in here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And I hope I&#39;m not making you dizzy, but this is the best way to explain this example that I could think of. And that&#39;s how it was explained to me. So you take the source. This is my source table, and then.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You put your destination table. So let&#39;s go to trial balance and then on trial balance. This is my destination table, which is the tb underscore table. So again I want to take values under the provision table and then I want to bring it under trial balance provision. This is the column debit and credits. This is where some numbers would be and I want them to come shop in trial balance.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So. I will put the source column name now here which is debits and credits. And then I would put the destination column name to the mouse and that&#39;s it. This is my mapping template. So. It&#39;s made. Super simple, just one.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Almost for you to be able to migrate data so this is a sample for table. If we&#39;re regular names, you would put the sourcing and then the destination name. And that&#39;s how migration would continue to happen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Go forward. What happened for you. Lots of migration on my mind. Okay. So let&#39;s close this. And then let&#39;s see what the process would look like. I obviously have no data in there, so I will not open it to show you what happens. But I do want to show you the options that are available when it comes to roll forward. So.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You would see. That gives me the ability to change the tax type. Pick a template. Here period. Jurisdiction. Code and scenario. Like you&#39;re used to doing it. Taking the option to validate mapping. You know what? I think? I picked Income Tax as a template. So let&#39;s go back.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because I don&#39;t want it to bind my mapping template in valid, so I want to make sure I use the ocp DataFlow one. That&#39;s correct. I&#39;m going to show you the validate. Option really quickly, because I want to go next and show you a couple of other things.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So again. You can change the year obviously don&#39;t mind to read 2005. You can select where I go forward to, and then you browse for your mapping templates. Let&#39;s say Launch mapping templates. And then it will validate the mapping for me.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Successfully ignore this. We&#39;re working on addressing that. Those little options there. Then it comes to. Your ability to change. The due date? Who is a scientific role? Forward. Excuse me a due date? You want to roll forward the notes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And attachments. And then you can decide who gets notified. So do you want to notify them all the assisting assignees or to get and choose new assignees. You don&#39;t want to assign it to anybody. You can also decide who gets notified.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the scroll forward is complete, or if there is an error, and then you can. Take folks from here and then others. You can just use the semicolon to keep adding the email. Now go forward the important point I want to make because if I don&#39;t everybody will be mighty upset me is the fact that.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s no longer an overnight process. We have implemented a queuing mechanism in the back end so roll forward can be. Pretty pronto for you depending on the time and day you choose, it could be immediate.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The whole roll forward option. And again. If several customers happen to go forward on the same date might take. A second for it to finish. But it says here it&#39;s scheduled because it is still a queuing process schedule to go forward.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You see it schedule forwards in progress and then when it finish rolling forward, it will just update it for me and you will see my request. Show up. Man meet. Okay. I&#39;m going to do a quick time check, and then I&#39;m going to show you a couple of orders for good on time.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s go to documents. You can come in here and upload documents. You can come in here and access documents that are associated with all your requests. So this here shows you all your documents. That are associated with several requests. Now if you want to upload a document, you would go to your request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And then we&#39;ll click on this little paperclip right here. And then you can add a document. You can drag a file. I&#39;m going to. Live in the uterine guide world right now. So to provide the documents that have handy and I figured let&#39;s keep them safe and secure of Pure, too. Why not.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can also make notes right here. And then you can Mark them as a result or Mark them as internal. So those features are also available for you. Doing another time check. You want to make sure. Time for some other questions. Okay. So that was all on documents. Let&#39;s go back to our slide. And I want to talk a little bit about migration roadmap. Okay. So when it comes to this pertains, obviously to our current customers. When it comes to conversion from our classic DataFlow to the next Gen of DataFlow, you can set up your users, your common entities, domains of jurisdictions like I showed you.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the next generation platform, you can create your status templates. And then. In the next generation of DataFlow, you can use the converter. That we have available and I&#39;m going to show you a quick screenshot of it to convert your template and then upload.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It in an exchange system assign in use. Simple to say there are a couple of steps. I would say use certain opportunity to think through. Your template to optimize it. The converter will give you recommendations. It will tell you and by the way, by the time you start accessing because you&#39;re making so many changes to this, you&#39;re optimizing it further based on feedback we receiving from our beta customers or Testers or Femax beta testers as you like to call them. So it may look a little bit different, but.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Essentially it is doing the same thing. It is going to give you recommendations based on your template and then you will have the option to take those recommendations and just convert them so it will actually let you know.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These are the formulas. Here are all the names. These are the things I can convert. Here are the things that cannot convert. And then. Here are some examples for you or some comments. Around how you can optimize your template so.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It will do all of that. I know. Sounds pretty amazing. And. It is. But then it is up to you to convert your template and upload it. Or optimize it further before you go ahead and start using it. So think of that.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I do want to show you some range names. How the conversion options got. I can&#39;t tag anymore. I&#39;m bumbling. So it shows you how you can go from classic to next Gen. So Range Names Range Name The Wildcard for the DC table.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Managing Your Data Collection Process Using ONESOURCE DataFlow:</h1><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Welcome, everyone.

Upon completion, Attendees will be able to identify functionality of ONESOURCE DataFlow and recognize how it can be utilized to manage the data collection process within tax. I will start with typical approach to collecting data and common challenges around the data collection process. Then I will share some of the opportunities for improvement and how once there&#39;s DataFlow can help in each one of those areas of improvement. Before we get started. Let&#39;s actually start do our first polling question. The first question is, are you currently using</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ONESOURCE DataFlow? Yes or no. And I&#39;ll give you a few seconds so that you can</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">answer. Great, thank you. So why is data management so important. Well in Tax Every Minute counts. Unfortunately, we see that many tax departments spend majority of their time on management and data management tasks from managing and consolidating those excel tax packages, resending the updated versions, and keeping track of the status of all those packages, figuring out who has responded and who has not. Without an efficient data management solution, leaders are struggling to get to the point where they can effectively gather the data from different stakeholders. Integrate the data with the relevant tax processes to get the visibility and access to the data and business on a global basis and ultimately analyze the data to get an understanding of what&#39;s going on on a global business, on the global basis and to make timely business decisions. Closing these gaps require a solution</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that. Integrates tax and technology. That can evolve with you. Your needs and your challenges. Let&#39;s dig deeper into some of the challenges that you may be facing today with your current data collection processes. All right. So here we have listed some of the common excel issues that we&#39;ve seen. And personally, I&#39;ve seen a lot of this. It&#39;s not all of them, right. When I worked with our customers. And you&#39;re not alone, right? A lot of customers do have these common excel issues in their current. Data collection process. So let&#39;s take a look one by one when it comes to the lack of security and controls. Actually, if you have that issue today, you&#39;re not alone. The 40% of the finance and tax professionals identify this particular challenge as their biggest challenge that they have when it comes to version control. So how many. Times. Have you had a package that was good to go. You&#39;ve already sent it out to all of. Your stakeholders globally, right. And after you hit Send, you found that. Something was missing. So you had to actually go back, update all those packages with that change and had to resend out the updated version. So that&#39;s again, very common when it comes to version control. 67% have version control difficulties. So it&#39;s not only dealing with the different versions to find out what is that final. Final. Right. What&#39;s the ultima final version, but also when you actually deal with these multiple packages for all of your global operations, you&#39;re dealing with a lot of in terms of the numbers, right. A large number of packages. So to update. Those packages. It could be very time consuming. Third one that I wanted to talk about is more on the data entry into the packages. Right. So whether you&#39;re entering the data or reviewing the formulas, also, all those linked workbooks where you have different tabs and the data is flowing. From one to the other. Imagine if you have new companies or new accounts, right. How many times do we have to go back and make sure that. All of the formulas are working as expected, and we&#39;re actually pulling all this new information. For that period right. To make sure that we add a new column for a new entity or accommodate for the new adjustments and so forth. In fact, 53% indicate that the updating information within the work papers is their most time consuming tasks, whether it&#39;s populating the data. Or making sure these formulas are working. And of course, the roll forward. When you have these workpapers, of course, the goal is to use. These work papers from period to period. But there will be the rollforward component, right. How do we make sure that all of these components are rolling forward properly. In fact, we found that that up to 80% of the finance and tax professionals stay is consumed by the data management tasks such as these and all these tasks are prone to these different errors. That. We are actually talking about right now those common excel issues. So how can ONESOURCE DataFlow actually help with these challenges? Well, as a tool in the ONESOURCE data Management portfolio, dataflow helps our customers streamline and automate the data collection process. While embedding greater control and security on data throughout the lifecycle. So we&#39;ll talk a little more in detail. Once your DataFlow can address these specific challenges that we just talked about. We&#39;re going to start with your existing excel workbook and we&#39;re going to convert it into ONESOURCE dataflow templates, which is stored within the ONESOURCE data platform. It provides the security and controls and prevents end users from making unauthorized edits to the document. We&#39;re going to leverage the existing workpapers, which means that you don&#39;t have to start from scratch, right? Our goal here is to leverage as</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">much as we can. And really utilize what you currently have, but really turn that into a ONESOURCE DataFlow template. And I&#39;ll show you how we can do that in a bit. But once we turn it into ONESOURCE DataFlow template, just by turning it into the template, there are some added benefits you&#39;ll be able to get the security and controls that you. Lacked in excel. The template also solves for the version control issues that we talked about before. As there&#39;s only one master template that data providers utilize, so let&#39;s imagine. You have more than 100 packages that you deal with. For each period. So from just for the volume perspective, it&#39;s a lot to manage now if. You are doing that in excel today. You&#39;re dealing with 100 separate excel files, and maybe one could be. The version one could have multiple versions. So now you&#39;re dealing with more than 100 packages, and it&#39;s hard to keep track of what was final. You could have final final copy of the final. We know how that goes. So there can be a lot of issues around version control. As we spoke about having that ONESOURCE DataFlow template it solves for that version control. Issue. And as an admin or the power user of the DataFlow, you will be able to know exactly which version the data providers are utilizing, so it streamlines your process quite a bit. The data from systems or prior periods. So those are types of data that you don&#39;t want end users to change. Well, you can actually design the. Templates so that there aren&#39;t any unauthorized changes to the data or the calculations. The template can have logic built in so that the data provider only sees the information that they need or the data they need to provide. This template can also have the validations built in so that you get complete and accurate data coming back to you as part of the data collection process. So what we mean by that is having although we are utilizing that familiar excel work papers that everybody is used to. Because. The work papers have been turned into a once service DataFlow template. There are a lot of these added controls that you can build. You can have diagnostics validation checks built into the process so that. These kind of the checkpoints that are built in within the package itself to help with your review process to catch all those errors upfront so you don&#39;t have to wait until. The end of the day. To find those errors late in the process. So there are a lot of validations or diagnostics that I&#39;ve seen customers build in into this DataFlow template so that to help with their review process and really to guarantee that the data you&#39;re getting back is the quality and accurate data. The template that we are creating, they were talking about right now is stored in the onesource platform which automates a data collection. And how do we do that? Well, once you have the master template created and. You have assign it to the different users. Right. Going back to my example of having let&#39;s say more than 100 packages. That&#39;s a lot. The way that you can manage that is using that one true version, that master template that we&#39;ve created. You associate that to all the entities or the users that you need to send it out to, and the system automatically creates the email notifications. So maybe today if you&#39;re using excel, you may be attaching this empty template and sending it out. Sending the email out to multiple stakeholders. Right. So that they can download the excel file, enter their data, and send it back to you using ONESOURCE DataFlow. You don&#39;t actually have to use Outlook at all. So once. You have the master template ready, and you&#39;re ready to send it out to the data providers. All you do is you associate that to the users. Then maybe you assign due dates and only the entities that they&#39;re responsible for. After you go through that system is going to generate an email automatically for you. And within the email. The data providers will receive a link that they can click on. They&#39;ll enter their username and password, and once they&#39;re authenticated, they will only see the data request for which they&#39;re responsible. So there&#39;s the whole control issue again. Right. I&#39;ve seen it happening where by mistake the wrong template got into the hands of the wrong. People right. So in this case, you won&#39;t have to worry about that within ONESOURCE. Now let&#39;s say you sent out the request a while ago. You haven&#39;t gotten. A good really response rate. Then you can go back into our ONESOURCE dataflow system and generate any of the reminders. So the system also generates any reminders at any time. And so you never have to really utilize Outlook to send out emails regarding these data collection process. Our ONESOURCE DataFlow also tracks the status of each request. So rather than you following up with the users one by one or the users really reconciling or</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">organizing the tax packages via Outlook or storing in the Share drive. Really it&#39;s as simple as from the data provider&#39;s view, they get an email click on the link. It opens up their view of the data request that they&#39;re responsible for. They&#39;ll open up the request, enter what&#39;s required of them. Close it and save the data and then that&#39;s it. And when they are doing that, the system is able to keep track of the stat. Status so it knows when the particular request was opened, the user will be able to change the status to be completed or ready for review. That&#39;s all customized. Customizable for you so you have the whole kind of built in workflow related to the data collection process. Using ONESOURCE DataFlow. You can also store and organize any supporting documents. Attachments notes. That&#39;s related to this data collection process. So everything is contained within ONESOURCE platform. You don&#39;t have to go to shared drive.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You don&#39;t have to dig through the email. Where these stakeholders send you a separate email with the supporting documents. Everything is there for your review or for your audit support.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whether we&#39;re talking about. These specific templates, or any supporting documents or notes, anything that was submitted as part of the data collection process. Okay. So once the preparers actually enters the data, and the data gets stored within the ONESOURCE platform, right. So that&#39;s where we&#39;ll be able to. Because the data is actually stored within the ONESOURCE. It&#39;s going to be really easy to retrieve the data. So imagine now we&#39;re at a point where the preparers or data providers have completed. These packages. Right your current process. May look like something. Where these providers are emailing you back the packages so you might get a lot of attached emails with attachments. And now you have to consolidate them. Right? Because if you have all those different packages, you want to see the consolidated view, the global view of it. You might be using excel formulas macros I&#39;ve seen maybe a custom app that actually looks at these different individual. Excel files and come up with a consolidated view well for using DataFlow because the data that&#39;s captured within these data requests are stored within ONESOURCE. It really allows for easy retrieval of the data. By year, by tax type, by entity, by period, by. Whatever the metadata that you set up, it&#39;s very easy to retrieve those in a very standardized format, so the data is not stored in the individual excel files, nor are you linking the work papers through tabs or your troubleshoot or troubleshooting the issues that you&#39;re getting from your macros. Which all of these activities could increase the risk in your process because the workbooks are lacking the controls using ONESOURCE DataFlow, you don&#39;t have to worry about any of those because the data is stored within ONESOURCE database. You will have access to the data and you&#39;ll be able to really pull the data in any fashion. And it&#39;s quite effective. So we&#39;ll talk a little bit more about that later in the presentation. Now, once we have that data. Lastly, the data that you can review, right. So using the data that&#39;s been stored within the. ONESOURCE platform. What can you do with it? Well, you can aggregate them. For other work processes, workbooks processes, calculations, or you can use it in the data modeling or create reports based on that data. Also. After your review.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Your analysis and when you&#39;re ready to actually finally use the data that you&#39;ve collected using.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since the data is already sitting in ONESOURCE database, it&#39;s easy for us to take the data out of the DataFlow and send it to the Integrated Solutions on the same sponsors platform. So as an example, I&#39;ve seen customers utilizing. These data collection packages that they&#39;ve created. And really for their provision processes or income tax compliance or transfer pricing processes, just to name a few. They are able to leverage the data that they&#39;ve collected in dataflow and use it. In those different ones or systems, because all those solutions are on the same platform. So. It really eliminates the time that it takes for all the manual data entry. It also increases the accuracy from all the way the data collection process to the reporting. So overall, it reduces the time it takes to complete. The whole data cycle. Right. And it eliminates additional reviews that you may have to do if you kept this process in excel. So we&#39;ll talk a little more about how these different steps. Like starting with the data, how we can convert your tax package to the DataFlow template. What does it look like? What are some of the steps that you have to do? And also what does it look like from the data provider&#39;s perspective? Right.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Although we&#39;re using excel, it&#39;s not exactly excel. So what does that look like for them. And how</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">we can ultimately leverage or put together. The data, put together the reports and send it to other onesource applications. We&#39;ll talk about that in a bit. Now before we do that, I also wanted to share with you some of the use cases. That we&#39;ve seen. When we worked with the customers. So as you can see and these are, of course, just to capture some of the use cases. We have a very large number of customers utilizing DataFlow today. I wanted to really share that the DataFlow solution is an agnostic tool. It&#39;s not designed for specific tax processes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Instead. It&#39;s really there for you to utilize it when it comes to collecting data, or maybe. Once you collect the data and integrate it with your processes. And when it comes to provision, process or income tax compliance, transfer pricing, audits, whatever it may be like financial reporting, we&#39;ve seen all different types of use cases. So by sharing this list, I don&#39;t want you to limit yourselves to this, but just to give you an idea. What have our large customers have done in the past using dataflow. So you see that some of the examples are like tax adjustments, right? Customer utilize DataFlow to house their trial balance, the tax adjustments and then once it was all collected. And in this DataFlow work papers. Then those adjustments were then pushed to once there&#39;s tax provision. Another example around the provision and return. So a lot of times these packages or the DataFlow templates are created. So that. There&#39;s a whole workflow component to it. Right. So. The DataFlow template is not there only to collect information, but you can have that back and forth. So. In this use case you can see that. The management could review and also be able to provide feedback for the preparers. And so it&#39;s kind of on the back and forth that it gets captured throughout the process. So you don&#39;t have to look at the emails for the back and forth. Everything is kind of contained within the one service DataFlow. And another example that I&#39;ll just talk briefly about is around the transfer pricing. So. You may again not only related to. These compliance and provision but transfer pricing another area where once source provides solutions for and. This particular customer replaced their existing processes in excel and. They were able to collect. The necessary information and also. Perform the actual allocation of certain costs as part of the transfer pricing processes. So really the idea here is that the DataFlow is not really designed for a very specific use case. It&#39;s really there. The technology is there for you to adopt and. Really use it for your to address your challenges. In your process. So you might wonder, how do I actually get to create these DataFlow templates? I don&#39;t know where to start. Well, as part of the implementation process, the Thompson Reuters implementation, the professional services team will be able to help you develop the first couple of workbooks with you. So we&#39;ll take a look at what you currently</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">have. And understand what your current challenges are. So we&#39;ll try to incorporate some of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">those validation checks or diagnostics when we turn your workbooks into the DataFlow templates so they will be able to capture a lot of those during the data collection process. And you don&#39;t have to wait until the end to catch those errors. Throughout that whole process. You&#39;ll be able to learn how. To replicate what we&#39;ve done. With our workbooks and you can then take other workbooks or other tax packages that you may have. And so I&#39;ve seen customers really grasping the idea of and the benefits of the ONESOURCE DataFlow. And from the implementation, they come out with all the knowledge. And expertise. And they&#39;re able to tackle. Take the other work papers or the data collection packages, turn those into DataFlow templates on their own. So it&#39;s definitely possible to do and we would encourage you to really join our professional services team during the implementation to see how the ONESOURCE DataFlow can help with your processes. All right. So with that. Now in the following few slides, what we have is some of the areas or opportunities for improvement. Right. So we&#39;re going to talk specifically about. How we that once search DataFlow can help with your current process and address. Some of the challenges you have in excel. So first of all, let&#39;s start with. The first one optimizing. How we can optimize your existing finance packages and work papers with the ones whose DataFlow the first one is. How do we leverage your existing excel workpapers?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Right. The goal here is that we want to use what you currently have and standardize it so that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you&#39;re dealing with that one through Master template. Right? You don&#39;t have. Multiple versions out there you have. The one true template that you manage. So what does that look like? So in</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the next slide, what we&#39;ve captured is that this is an example or the screenshot of your existing excel work papers. Right? Some of you guys may have workpapers that look like this. The lead sheet, along with the adjustments in each tab. So. It&#39;s a workbook that you&#39;ve created to calculate your book text adjustment. Right. And each tab is dedicated to each tax adjustment. And one of the starting point would be, as you might have a tab dedicated for, let&#39;s say, trial balance. Well, how do we actually turn your existing workpapers. Into a dataflow template and. There&#39;s an excel Add-in as you can see here, that you can leverage. To turn these into a DataFlow template. So as an example, we have a concept of a table. So. You&#39;ll be able to create a table. And. The range selection for that. So really, what we&#39;re trying to do is that the look and feel right. It is still excel. But what we are trying to do is that our Add-ins help you create more control around it, create more security around your work papers. So that after you go through all these steps. Your file may look very similar to what you currently have, but it&#39;s going to have more validations, more diagnostics, more controls built into that. So I just wanted to quickly point out that the goal here is to leverage what you have and standardize to come up with that one master template. And we have the excel add-in to help you with. That process.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay. So we just talked about the standardizing. The next one is that secure, Web based template. We talked about how once you create these templates, they are not stored within excel, but they are actually stored within one Serve database. So what does that mean? Right. So. We are leveraging or we are actually extending the capabilities of excel. Everybody loves excel. I love excel. And I&#39;ve seen customers who really love to create their processes in excel, and we&#39;re all familiar with it. Everybody knows excel. So that&#39;s one of the reasons why we really can&#39;t get away from excel. But excel does have some of those challenges that we. Talked about so how do we marry up the best world, right. The fact that we&#39;re familiar with excel. The flexibility within excel, but also. The lack of control that excel has, how. Do we really make it more robust by building a more security, more controls? That&#39;s where once there&#39;s DataFlow is all about right. Really marrying of the both worlds of the database, the technology more</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">robust. And more controls that are built into your template while it looks very familiar to what you currently have. Okay. So from here. As you can see. In the screenshot here we have something called Fill color. When we were talking about the challenges, I mentioned something about once there&#39;s DataFlow can be designed to prevent users from overriding some of the data. So like things like rolled over balances or some of the data that you pulled from</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">systems. You don&#39;t want the users to change those, right? You want to keep them locked so that the users can see those, but you don&#39;t want them to override what you pulled from different from prior period or from this particular system. Well, that&#39;s where this fill color comes in, because the fill color. As an admin or the power user you get to dictate. What sales user the data providers have access to actually type in or edit right. So. In this case, I&#39;m selecting blue as an example. Right. And let me go into the next slide to show you one of the tabs that I have here. Do you see some cells are blue, some are white. Well, when the data providers open</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">up. Their request. It looks something like this. And all the blue cells because we designated bluetooth VR fill color. All the blue cells will be open for edits, whereas the white cells would be locked down so the users so you see as an example. We already have the data coming in. For some of this, the book balances, the beginning of the year or the end of the year. The book balances is what it is. Right. So you&#39;ll see a lot of the first row really saying that. We actually grabbed this from the books. And these are the M adjustments that was driven by it, but the manual adjustment is blue, meaning that users are able to make additional adjustments on top of what has already been calculated. So designing the template like this certainly within excel, we don&#39;t have ability to. Lock this lock or unlock on the cell basis, but dataflow will give you that ability. So it adds the security and a control that we talked about. Great. So we talked about.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How we can standardize your existing workpapers, how we can extend the capability of excel and in particular, we have this fill color concept where you can lock down certain cells and you can open up some of the cells to really get the cost that the data provider&#39;s input. The next one is more on the controls. So here&#39;s the automated notification, the reminders, and the tracking of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the status. We spoke a little bit about that as well. One of the common challenges, right with the excel process is around these controls. Because now when you have a lot of the packages, a lot of the stakeholders involved, how do you keep up with all that, like the status of it? How do you keep up with all those? How do you really reach out to them. The notification portion of it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You may be dealing with a lot of emails. Now what the system, how ONESOURCE dataflow can help with is the fact that we&#39;ll be able to create and manage. These requests and also you. When you log into the ONESOURCE DataFlow screen, you&#39;ll be able to see that. This particular as an example template called Income Tax Package. Exact same package has been utilized for all these companies that you see here. So one master template right addressing that version control issue. So one point of management now what we&#39;re looking at is that you see that the Income Tax package and it&#39;s repeated multiple. Times. Well, it&#39;s for the different entities that we want to collect the data from. Right. So you have the visibility of the status on each one of these data requests. You see that in the status column, some of them, most of them says in progress. That&#39;s great. Right. And one of them was completed. The kudos for Karen. But the last one. Let&#39;s take a look at this one. Not started. So how does a system know. To distinguish right, not started versus in progress. Well, remember when you have these. Let&#39;s say you had that master template called Income Tax Package ready to be sent out. Right. So you come into one service DataFlow. You create this request, which is really within three, four mouse clicks. You&#39;ll be able to create these multiple data requests. Within our solution, you&#39;ll be able to assign. The users and the due dates or so forth. So you&#39;ll be able to really manage all that within when you create these requests and you&#39;ll be able to send out emails. Now when you actually send out the emails right. I mentioned the system actually generates an email and that gets sent out to the data provide. Providers and within that email, data providers will open it up and they&#39;ll see a link and they&#39;ll be able to click on the link to log into ONESOURCE DataFlow in the database. Once they actually with the platform. Once they enter their username and password, they&#39;ll be able to see only the request. And I actually have a screenshot of what their view would look like later on. So I&#39;ll talk a little more about that. What the process looks like from the data provider&#39;s perspective. But let&#39;s stay with you guys. Right. The corporates, the admins at the corporate. Now, once we send out the email. Then we&#39;re kind of relying on these days stakeholders to fill out the forms and we want to check the statuses. So one way to do that is kind of come back to this screen, take a look at the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">statuses. That&#39;s one way. But another way is that. You might want to. Make sure that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">everybody actually got the email and actually is working on it, right. You understand that? Okay. People do have some time and it&#39;ll take some time for them to complete it. But when you log in and you see this not started, that means this user has not even opened up the package. So then you can now create a reminder email or. Send it out because you know that that person hasn&#39;t even started working on this particular request. So. There are different statuses right without even having to go into each one of these requests. You&#39;ll have a way to know whether like the you have the visibility to the status of each one of those requests, along with the due date and who it&#39;s assigned to. And of course, the status. So Yeah. And while we are here, I also wanted to point out the version control, since we&#39;re talking about different controls here. Let&#39;s say we worked on the income tax package. And. It was all good. Now with the tax reform hit and I need to update the income tax package to reflect the tax reform. Well, if I have 100 packages, do I actually have to update it 100 times? The answer is no because once there&#39;s DataFlow utilizes one master template, we can just take the master template, update that update it once and. Cascade down to the request so you don&#39;t have to worry about managing. These different so don&#39;t be alarmed about having large number of requests. You are just from the management perspective and maintenance perspective, you&#39;re actually updating the master template. So that really helps when it comes to when you&#39;re dealing with large volume of the requests there. All right. So as a recap we talked about. The controls there. The last one is from the data providers perspective, right? How does that look. Well. That&#39;s where they will only be able to see the request that they&#39;re responsible for. So they don&#39;t see a lot</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">more. Like you guys at the corporate or as an admin, you may see hundreds of DataFlow requests, and you probably want to see those to keep track of the statuses. Well, for the data providers, they are only going to see handful. The packages. That are actually assigned to them. So what does that look like? And also. How can they attach any supporting documents or notes? So let&#39;s take a look at their kind of portal view so it looks quite similar but. It&#39;s much smaller, right. What we see here is that. This particular user is responsible for a couple of entities. And we see that. For this one, we&#39;re looking at different years. So that&#39;s why we see four rows. But. Much more simplified. It does capture a lot of information like due dates and statuses. And whatnot really the goal here is that. From the data providers perspective, they have four buttons, one open. Right. This would be click on Open. They&#39;ll be able to actually retrieve the request. That they are being asked to fill out status is where they actually once they complete. The task, they&#39;ll be able to go into that status screen or click on that button to update the status and that started in progress and completed. So. Those statuses are all customizable for you guys. So it&#39;s all user defined. You can have a prepared, reviewed. Performed final Review. However. You want to call those statuses, you&#39;ll be able to modify them within the system. In addition to the status, we have two other. Buttons stocks. So the data providers will be able to upload any of the supporting documents that they need to include or any notes. So I think going back to when we talked about. How DataFlow works, right. I mentioned something around. Not only are we able to capture the data that we intended to really collect from these different providers, but we&#39;re also able to. Capture any of the supporting documents that may be useful for your review purposes. For audit support, or any notes going back and forth that you want to capture. So yeah, again. These data providers will receive an email, a system generated email with the hyperlink. Once they click on the link, they&#39;ll be able to log in with their own username and password. And once they&#39;re in the portal, this is the view that they&#39;re going to see. All right. So. Just as a recap. I know we talked briefly about. Try to kind of capture the highlights of each one of these pillars. So first we talked about how we can standardize your existing excel workpapers by turning your work papers into a DataFlow template. Then we talked about the concept of the fill color as an example. Right there. Of course, many more functionalities available, but typically. Using that fill color, you designate what cells to be locked versus what cells to be open to cap to collect the data from the data providers. Next, we talked about the controls, right. How we can send out the notifications reminders, all from the automated from the system, so you don&#39;t have to manually generate those. And keep track of the statuses. We just took a look at the data provider portal, which is. Can not only complete.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">What they&#39;re asked to provide from the data collection perspective, but also how they can</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">attach supporting documents and also capture notes. Now the next one is. About now that we&#39;ve captured all the data and the data is all stored in the cloud. Right. All the data that gets captured within the DataFlow template. Is going to be stored within our data, ONESOURCE database. We talked about the fact that. It doesn&#39;t get. The data that we collected is not embedded within excel. Instead, it actually gets stored within our centralized ONESOURCE database, which allows us to actually go. To the next thing, which is the data aggregation and analysis. What does that look like? Right? Instead of manually putting all those excel files together using macros or the formulas, what you can do is you actually pull directly from our ONESOURCE database. What you&#39;re looking at here is that you see up at the top. We have different companies. With the timestamps. So designed this report so that you can actually run extraction of the data from these different DataFlow requests. Each column you can imagine is a DataFlow request, right? Different people filled it out. But for you guys. At the headquarters as an admin, you have ability to pull the information and look at all the companies in one place and using the flexibility in excel and the fact that we stored all this data in the ONESOURCE database. Very efficient process to pull all these data points. Into. This one place, right. So you don&#39;t have to go to you don&#39;t have to open up all these hundred requests and grab the data.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You have ability to really extract the data from the database directly into this without even having to open those 100 individual requests. So. Very efficient process. Of retrieving the data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No copying and pasting. You don&#39;t have to worry about the formulas being broken. Really once it&#39;s inside. That the data request that the providers enter the data in it goes into the ONESOURCE database so that we can actually pull this and leverage it really downstream in the tax processes that you have. So yeah, I think. It really talks to. How powerful DataFlow is not only. Can we address those typical excel challenges? But we&#39;re also able to make the process much more efficient. Lastly, what I have for you here is that how we can automate. So it&#39;s great that we&#39;ve collected the data and we were able to aggregate the data and come up with more of a consolidated view of the data. What do we. Do with that. Right. So from here, really, the reason that we collect all this information is so that we can leverage it for. The downstream tax processes, whether it&#39;s income tax provision, income tax compliance, transfer pricing, just to name a few. So that&#39;s kind of where all these are coming into play so we can leverage. These tools like ONESOURCE work papers to push the data. And in this case, we&#39;re pushing the data into ONESOURCE tax provision. So it&#39;s in a really end to end process, right from the data collection all the way to the integration. How we can push the result. Into ONESOURCE systems. So right now, once there&#39;s work papers, we have it available for a number of solutions, such as Once there&#39;s income tax provision back, section manager, the operational transfer pricing, and so forth. So we&#39;re able to really utilize. Other ONESOURCE. The functionalities right, the excel add-in or the work papers, and so forth with the data that we&#39;ve collected using dataflow. So let&#39;s actually take a moment and do our second polling question. In which DataFlow use case. Are you most interested? One direct tax, two indirect tax, three transfer pricing, four other. I&#39;ll give you a few seconds so that you can let us know.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Where your interest lies now that you&#39;ve seen the power of DataFlow. Okay. So thank you for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that. So let&#39;s take a look at more in the visual way what we talked about how once there is DataFlow can help you streamline your process of data collection. So on the left hand side, you see the source systems, whether we are gathering the data from erp or other systems. We talked about the fact that you can extract data into. Excel. And we can leverage that as part of our ONESOURCE DataFlow template, right. Those were the data that you probably don&#39;t want the user to override. So think about those white cells, right? Versus the blue cells that we talked about. So the data that you&#39;ll be retrieving from these systems will be visible to the data providers, but they won&#39;t be able. To overwrite or change the data. So that data can be available within the DataFlow within the template and it&#39;ll be part of the DataFlow templates that data providers have access to. Right. Okay. So once we generate the DataFlow request. And. Once you as an administrators, right, you could generate those requests. And what happens is that they&#39;ll get a link, right? An email with a link where they can log in. You can also send reminders, so you see how you&#39;ll be able to do that directly within ONESOURCE. So you don&#39;t have to utilize your email software for that, such as. Outlook. So you have that kind of the ongoing communication with the data providers there now when they open up. So when they receive an email, there will be a hyperlink where the data providers can click on and they&#39;ll be able to log in using their own user credentials and they can populate the template that was assigned to them. So as they populate the data. Remember, the data doesn&#39;t actually reside within the excel file itself, but it goes back into the DataFlow, the ONESOURCE database along with any attachments or the notes. So. We took a quick look at what the data provider portal looks like. Right? So they had only a few options. Open up the DataFlow request, upload. Any supporting documents, add any notes and update the statuses to notify you after. The providers actually submit the DataFlow request. All the data gets stored within the DataFlow database. And here administrators. So those will be the you guys at the headquarters. You will have access. To the extraction reports. So that was when since the data is stored within ONESOURCE database, you&#39;ll be able to. Efficiently. Take the data out of DataFlow Database into excel. Create your own reports so the example that I shared with you there was that remember the columns going across. And we had the data pulled with the timestamps. So you&#39;ll be able to consolidate the data that you&#39;ve collected using ONESOURCE DataFlow. So those are some of the things that you&#39;ll be able to do. Okay. So let&#39;s move on to the next. Slide,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">here. So kind of step by step. Right. Also, we wanted to share the different ways of how this could work, how ONESOURCE DataFlow can help you improve your current process. So let&#39;s take. Another visualization kind of step by step, what we just covered in this session. So First, here&#39;s your tax Department in the headquarters. Once you have the DataFlow template again, those will be the existing excel templates you already have. We want to leverage as much as possible. We have some of the functionalities like how you can lock some of the cells and as read only view, and also you can open up some of the cells like blue cells that we saw that you want the user to enter data into. So once you go through that kind of the template transformation, right. And create a ONESOURCE DataFlow template, you can create the request. And assign them to the different users. Once that happens on the local controller. So off to the right. So these would be the data providers. They&#39;ll get an email with the link that they can log into. So let&#39;s say we had two folks right over here. So they actually got an email when they open up, these would be you see those some of the blue cells versus the white cells, right. So that&#39;s kind of one of the first steps. Now, once, let&#39;s say this person here went ahead and logged in and enter the data from there. You at the headquarters. You actually have visibility to the status, right. Remember that some of the template, most of the requests were in progress, but we. Had a couple of them that were completed, but one that was not even started, right. So you have visibility to the status throughout your data collection process. And you can also send out emails or. The reminders if you wanted to so you have the full visibility. There. Now because you&#39;re able to keep track of the statuses. So you&#39;ll be able to see who actually submitted on time or. Who actually did late. Right. So. This person was able to submit it in time, but the other person you see that. Hasn&#39;t actually submitted yet, so you can actually set up automated reminders. Right. So that from the system. So to remind them, hey, you haven&#39;t submitted it, so please go ahead and submit your request. So now that person goes in and enters the data, the data gets stored within ONESOURCE. The second column here is the ONESOURCE column. Now, from there. Now that all the data has been submitted and has</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">been stored within the ONESOURCE database, it&#39;s going to help. With your review process. So</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">all those requests that we&#39;ve created. You&#39;ll be able to pull those right through the extraction. And from there, you can create as many reports as you like. Remember all those supporting documents and the notes that the data provider submit will be part of the ONESOURCE database as well. So it really has the full audit trail of not only the data you intended to collect. But along with all the communications and supporting documents before we conclude our session today, I just wanted to recap some of the benefits that we talked about. Our ONESOURCE DataFlow as well as ONESOURCE workflow manager solutions are here to really help you add more automation to your process so that you can have more</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">efficien. Efficiency and control around those processes. You can help eliminate manual tasks and improve controls. Also, you can use our solutions to collaborate more effectively. From all the way from data collection to how you can leverage the data for your tax compliance needs and also reporting needs. And lastly, you get to see the visibility. Into all those different tasks that are going around your processes using ONESOURCE. Lastly, I wanted to share some of the use cases in these different areas. In polling question number two, I asked which area you would be interested in using DataFlow. So these are just some of the examples. Just please keep in mind that these are not the DataFlow is not limited to these use cases. As you get familiar with our solution. You&#39;ll be able to really apply DataFlow to any of the processes that you have. And lastly, the last polling question we have is Would you like to learn more about ONESOURCE DataFlow? Yes or no.

I&#39;m the park manager for dataflow and Ultra connectors.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I have been with tr for about 13 years and I&#39;ve worked on various products, such as the Platform Entity manager. Global Tax Audit Manager workflow Suite and Client manager. I have my undergrad degree in computer science and technology, and I have a master&#39;s in it and management, and I&#39;m excited to be here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pete, over to you. Hey, everybody, this is Pete, Jenner. I am the dev manager for dataflow and as well as a couple of other onesource products. I&#39;m responsible for development the architecture planning release, working with prochi to make sure everything&#39;s where it needs to be.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve learned toms from lawyers now for eleven years I&#39;ve led participated in. Or even designed some of the some other ONESOURCE products, including Datablood Classic Audit Manager, Global Tax Audit Manager, R and D work papers, and a few others. I started working in this industry in 1999.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Primarily with tax preparation products, or accountants, individuals, Corps, and enterprises. Thanks. Okay, let&#39;s talk about the learning objective again. Another thing I have to read address. Upon completion, attendees will be able to understand the evaluation of the evolution of the next generation tool, recognize improvements to the user experience, and new functionality, and analyze the value it can bring.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To processes. All right. Let&#39;s talk about what we&#39;re going to do today. So I&#39;m going to go over briefly, what is DataFlow and what it can do for you. Then we&#39;re going to talk about the new things we have done poor, the new DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So it&#39;s truly new things. We have the APIs. Going to show you the integration between Data Hub and DataFlow. There are some transition tools we want to talk about. Specifically, the ability to pull.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Classic data into the new DataFlow that is going to show us. And then I&#39;ll talk about roadmap. And that will be it. All right. So let&#39;s look at. ONESOURCE DataFlow, how it works and what it is all about. So DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At its core is excel based. It is excel that you then convert it into a Web based DataFlow template. Right. So it&#39;s your tax package, the way you&#39;re used to using it. But. You have now using the DataFlow technology, made it into a web based form almost in which you can collect information from your preparers. You can then also not only collect this information because it&#39;s all excel you can process.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And then. Share it with your reviewers to review the information. After all of this computation, you can store this data in our database and then securely access it as needed. Because it&#39;s your work paper. All your calculations are still possible. And then at the end of all of this, you&#39;re able to transfer it and share it with our compliance software. And I say ours with the new DataFlow. With the apis being available, you can really share it with any product that you want to.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So let me talk a little bit about the common challenges. Around data that you face every day, the biggest one being. There is always multiple source of data. And with COVID and all of us being in different locations that has become even more apparent.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That you need a secure place to share exchange information. Especially such as the Tax information. It&#39;s also still a lot of manual tracking of information happening out there and using Outlook to figure out who has finished something is a nightmare in itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And that I had personally lived through before. There&#39;s also the lack of standardization, right? You get data from one person in one format. The other one is different. You now are responsible for converting it all, putting it together in one format.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That makes sense only to turn around and find that another set of data came and yet under different shape and form. So that is always very time consuming and it makes it difficult to manage and share information.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And at the end of it all, it creates more risk for errors because there is lack of control around the process and dataflow answers for all of these with DataFlow, you are able to have a centralized process. You&#39;re able to standardize.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your tax packages and collection, and it&#39;s all at a centralized, secure location. For your preparers to go review your reviewers to access and your data providers to share information with you. Once when it is done in a standard process, in a standard fashion, it&#39;s that much more easier for you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To wrap around it. And. Again remove the risk. Make it faster. Have it secure and have access control around it so that in a nutshell is data throw. So now let&#39;s talk about. What&#39;s new with DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are quite a few new features that we developed throughout 21. The first one is apis. The apis are available to you for DataFlows in the dev portal. The next is the Data Hub integration. This is our answer for the glm integration process that many have asked. But it&#39;s also so much more because Data Hub is not just about trial balance. You can store any form of data in it, and dataflow is able to access that data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So you can collect more information around that data or process it for a calculation and then share it with other compliance. Products. We also did client management, but we won&#39;t deep dive into it because that&#39;s more for our firms.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And then we want to talk about our Transition tool. So I will touch upon the process. Show you the converter and then. We have P, of course, on the call with us. He&#39;s going to go over the dcds method, which has specifically designed to allow you to pull your classic request data into your new data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And then there&#39;s also a snapshot functionality, which lets you create an excel copy of your request and then save it in documents. So let me start by talking about APIs. The DataFlow apis are live. They are available on the developer portal and you can all access them if you want to know how to get access to it or start working with the dataflow apis. Please talk to your csm if you have any questions around the api, please feel free to leave it in the.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chat, box. I don&#39;t know if you can see. Because on my screen I see my camera here. But essentially, you have the ability to pull data out of any request. Push data back in. You&#39;re able to manage your statuses, your templates, so there&#39;s a lot you can do with the APIs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can pretty much manage your DataFlows. Open them, Change status, save. Assign all of it without coming into the DataFlow application. If you utilize these APIs. Here is a custom dashboard that was put together.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By our solution consultants using some of the apis available so I can click through that one really fast. I think this is one where you can see by. Region. Jurisdiction they used to be rule of your data for requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And. Here&#39;s your template, and then how it is assigned to. So again, these are some samples, but I&#39;m sure you can do so much more than these. So with this, I&#39;m going to pass it on to P to share and talk about the DataFlow and data Hub integration over to your.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thanksgiving. Let me just get some stuff up here and I&#39;ll share. Sure. So. One of the great things about dataflow is that we just recently started integrating with Data Hub. Data Hub is a great tool for storing just about any data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Need to find the Share button here. And just a quick time check for you. We are at eleven minutes only so you have plenty of time. Excellent. So with dataflow if you&#39;re familiar with. Once we&#39;re solved, we have a product called Data Hub. And inside Data Hub, I&#39;m not going to get into details on Data Hub, but Data Hub provides the ability for you to bring in data, organize data in various ways, import it and manipulate that data to a certain end state. And at the end state for us right now is a.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Collection. And a collection. Is basically data that has been published and made available to other products. So real quick, I just wanted to show you this is Data Help Screen. These are collections, and they have various tools that allow you to go ahead and handle data that you bring in here. So in the case of proceed reference to glm replacing glm, you can bring your trial balances in here from multiple sources and aggregate them into a single collection that you can then access through data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flow. So I&#39;ll go back to dataflow real quick. And in dataflow. I&#39;m going to go ahead and open a request. That was based off of data hub and I&#39;ll get into the design of that not too long afterwards. So inside this request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As it launches. So this Ray request is going to what it&#39;s going to do is download a template, and I&#39;ll show you the design of this template that went ahead. And it&#39;s looked in Data Hub and asked for collections related to a blueprint, which is what Data Hub calls or users is what they use to describe the type of data you&#39;re collecting. And we&#39;re asking Data Hub for.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All the collections based off of that blueprint. In this case there&#39;s three. And in the case of this template, I&#39;m doing a gap stat. So I&#39;m going to go ahead and bring in select my gap data. And now I&#39;m going to select my stat data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And once that&#39;s there. Dataflow. We&#39;ll go ahead and request from a request toolbar. We&#39;ll click refresh. And you can see the data is almost instantaneously there. So what just happened. So as soon as I click that refresh button.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dataflow looked at what collections I&#39;ve selected, and it&#39;s brought them down, and it&#39;s placed them here. So here&#39;s the gap that came from Data hub. Here&#39;s the stat that came from Data Hub. And then I&#39;ve aggregated that information on this sheet. And I&#39;m going to be able to collect adjustments based off that as well as all this data. And eventually.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Through the Systems and Data Hub. And when you talk to the Data Hub people, they&#39;ll explain to you how to bring this data. In its entirety into Data hub. So how do I get? How do you get there. Let me go to the I&#39;m going to go ahead and close that request first.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And this is the template. So I&#39;m going to go ahead and unprotect this and talk a little bit about it. So as I stated earlier. This is the landing area for the Gap data. The Gap collection that was selected. This is the landing area.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Where the stack collection from Data hub and then once again this aggregates that data. All this sheet pretty much does is it uses the newer filter function from available in excel 365 and it pulls over all the data from the gap and fills out this area.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I Then I use a vlookup to look up the account information and entity information. On the stat workbook statue and populate this so this keeps the data aligned. And then you can collect your adjustments here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sorry to interrupt you. You just cut out just a little bit. Could you mind going over that part again. Where you said it looks up the vlookup. I think there is something in the background. That&#39;s fine.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As I was saying, I bring the gap data over here using the entire gap data using the filter function and then over here on the stat. We&#39;ll make sure I align all my accounts in my account descriptions in cases are not quite aligned inside each collection. I use a vlookup to align the entity and the account code to make sure I get the correct stat balance here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Basic excel if you look up, it&#39;s looking up the lookup value that I&#39;ve designated and it&#39;s going to the stack and checking the entity account code to get the other information. So real quick, how do you get how do you and how do you tie these together.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So I&#39;m just going to click new template in dataflow. Choose an input color. And then. From my dataflow designer. The first thing I need to do is register. And once I register, let&#39;s say this is the area where I wanted to display.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">My collection. From a data hub. I will go to names. Blueprint. It&#39;s going to ask me the name of my blueprint, and I&#39;m just going to call this gap just for the heck of it, it&#39;s going to ask me what&#39;s the name of the blueprint I want to get. I&#39;m not going to put anything in here right now. I&#39;m just going to click search right. It&#39;s going to give me a list of all the available blueprints inside data hub. I&#39;m going to choose a blueprint.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then I&#39;m going to tell it where. I wanted to I got tell dataflow where I wanted to display the list of collections that are available for that blueprint when the request is opened. So I&#39;ll just select here. In this case I&#39;m going to put it on the same sheet.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Click OK. And once I click OK. Here what you&#39;re going to see is. Going to first put this input cell here and it&#39;s going to name it. This is where it will display that list. And you can tag it right. You can call it what you like.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And this is the blueprint. So it shows you what the blueprint will look like. And you can go ahead and adjust it and make this as pretty as you&#39;d like. And once you protect it and you upload it. The dayflow request will open. It will look for any of the blue, any of the recollections. If there&#39;s one, it will automatically retrieve that single collection and populate this list and expand the area.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If there&#39;s more than one, it will populate this list and allow you to select one before it populates the request, and then you could refresh it as stated with the Refresh button on the DataFlow Request toolbar.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And that is. How you design and pull data. From Data Hub into DataFlow and collect your adjustments or other inputs that you may want from your users. Back to you, pro. I can&#39;t hear you. Oh, I&#39;m sorry about that. So what I was trying to share as well is talk about.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How make a couple of extra points around the pulling data in from data hub into DataFlow and let me quickly share and talk about that. Okay. You should be able to see my screen now. So</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the year is important and also the period and what it does is it matches your collection. So not only your blueprint name and you saw Pete select a blueprint as you design that template. So that is one way to narrow down which collection value shows up.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in addition to that, the year that you associate with your request and your collection matters as well. And I have some examples of one collection versus multiple. I don&#39;t want to pull anything up right now, but when we are in the live class, I&#39;ll definitely show.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Showing multiple you saw that actually. In example, Pete did, he had the three options, whereas if he had just one match, it would just populate the request automatically. So you don&#39;t have to always be doing that selection. Drop down. It just depends on how many collections you matched on the other end, so I don&#39;t know if that makes sense.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I hope it does. All right, back to talking about the transition tool. Let me just go into presentation node. Bear with me. It always wants to do that. It always wants to. Put my presenter slides on the other one, no matter how many times I tell it not to. But let&#39;s talk about transition first. As we dive into Transition tools.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We understand it is an effort for you to transition to the next Gen application or the new DataFlow as we&#39;re supposed to call it. You have to move your entities. Your jurisdictions. You essentially have to not live anymore.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In that classic platform area and move into the new platform. So you have to have your new users special data provider users. Because in the new world there isn&#39;t a concept of user type called data provider. It&#39;s a permission that we manage. That&#39;s why you need to reestablish your provider users and give them the data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provider Permission within DataFlow. In our previous energy classes have gone through all of that. If you have questions, please type in in the chat and we&#39;ll be happy to answer any questions that come up or we can always connect later on offline.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But essentially, this is a manual effort. For the most part, the part which we could automate for you. We&#39;re trying to do that. And it&#39;s just the template. And positive by now you&#39;re aware you can&#39;t just take your classic template and then put that in the new DataFlow and use it as is.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You need to convert the template, run it through our converter. Which our development team created. And then have the new template uploaded new dataflow and use that going forward. So you could simply convert it using the converter and start a new DataFlow. However.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We recommend in order to get the best benefits in order for your template to really be super powerful in the new DataFlow that you analyze how you designed it and then. See, based on the new design tools that are available, such as the Table functionality. If it makes sense to think through some of the choices that you made in the past, maybe it will really impact your template performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I said maybe, but we&#39;re positive that if you do a little deeper dive in your template while you&#39;re converting, it will make a big difference. In the performance that you see from the system. And then of course.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You go to the new DataFlow and then sign and use it. So. Let me actually. Show you the conversion happen. I have this template open here. It&#39;s a stacked tax legacy template. Classic. I should call it that I borrowed from our Commission consultant team. They were gracious enough to allow me to use it for this demo purposes. Essentially, this is a template that is still a classic template. I have not converted it into the new DataFlow template yet.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And that&#39;s why I see my DataFlow converter option pop up here. So the converter once you&#39;ve installed it and I&#39;m sure you know how to get to it if you don&#39;t, it is here in your setup area. Right here. DataFlow terms at converter. That&#39;s where you&#39;re downloaded from.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once you have that installed. What you have to do. Is come on in over here and then click on this workbook inspect workbook option. It will tell you it may take a little bit for a larger workflow for it to finish inspection.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For this demo. That&#39;s why I chose a little simpler file because I wanted to show you the process and walk you through the process. Anyway, it inspected it and gave me some information and found something. It found time, DataFlow, name.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There were no formulas in here. I found some one other item. And at this point I can either just convert the workbook or I can export the recommendation. So I&#39;m going to click on export recommendations.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And. I am going to because I&#39;ve been doing the demo a lot. So let me. Have a number seven now. All right, I&#39;ll call it number eight and click save. So it&#39;s going to go save itself in one of my folders. Let me go. Open that up.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All right. We go in here. Sample template. And here is my recommendations. Oh, and I did all of that on my other screen, but it&#39;s coming. Bear with me. All right. So here is the psv that it saved. And then in here it has given me what it&#39;s recommending me to do and what it&#39;s going to do.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So it&#39;s saying the converter will take care of it. Yes. It&#39;s going to convert. These items into a DC range. It&#39;s telling me which item it is. It&#39;s the adjustment underscore name. Like repeating or Wildcard. I can&#39;t tell repeating, selling and it&#39;s going to make it into a DC range. And it&#39;s going to do the same thing for the next one to convert it into DC range. It&#39;s really smart. It will go through and convert things for you. So in this case a selling mid will do all of this for me. And then it found.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Something where I couldn&#39;t find the reference for so I will try to fix it. I will attempt to replace it, but maybe you want to fix it too. So that&#39;s the question. What should you do? Should you try and adjust everything before.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You convert or should you let the converter on itself and then you go back and fix more things. And I&#39;d ask Pete and our other developers this question, and the recommendation is to let it convert first.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So you go in, you go through the recommendation, take a look. If there&#39;s nothing glaring, gaping, go ahead and convert your workbook. And once you have converted your workbook, because then it&#39;s done some of the work for you. You can go back.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In and make the recommended changes as needed. So you go you can workbook. Click. Ok. It&#39;s telling me what it did. It&#39;s going to also create a log for me. Of what was not able to do.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Save and then I&#39;m going to save the conversion log.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And at this point this template has been converted. I do need to project this again using the data collection. Option, so I need to Mark it as a template and then protect it. Those are the two steps I need to take before I upload.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve seen folks forget to do the step, and then their request open, disconnected. We did a call saying, oh, for some reason, it&#39;s not recognizing my template as a template, though, because you need to make sure after you convert, you go through these two steps.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All right? So it opened my love over here? I&#39;m going to drag that over. So here is what your log one looks like. And I recommend you keep that saved. So you know exactly what the software did for you versus where it was not able to pick something. It will let you know.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That needs to be manually adjusted. These are the things that fixed it. Renamed it. And here&#39;s what it renamed it, too. Again helpful information that you want to make sure you track. Another</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">little pro tip. Make sure you turn off your auto save as you run through this process, you don&#39;t want to accidentally convert a template.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I did. Left the auto save on so it has been connoted. I&#39;m going to go back and Hunt for my classic. Template to keep it ready for my next demo, but that&#39;s essentially another tip. You don&#39;t want to accidentally save the changes, so make sure.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You create a copy, and then you go through your process of converting the template and the same tip I will give you. When you&#39;re working on creating that blueprint that people are sharing, because right now there isn&#39;t a way for you to go back and refer to your blueprint name that you used. I would say make an information shape, keep track of all of that information so you can go back and review it easily as needed.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All right. Let&#39;s see. I&#39;m going to go back to my deck. And I want to talk next about Map shot. So I really wanted to share this. In of course it will do that again. Hold on. I really wanted to show this live because we have parts of this working in our qa environment already.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So unfortunately for this recording, I will not be able to show it in QA. But I promise you, by the time we are all meeting together at the Live synergy, we will have this functionality working because it&#39;s in our qr environment. I just didn&#39;t want to show anything from QA.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To clear some more testing. Essentially, you will have the ability to create snapshots. Which is think of it as your DataFlow request that. Has been recalculated and then saved as an excel document.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So think of it as your disconnected DataFlows almost. We will recalculate everything. And we&#39;ll say that the hides will still work. That&#39;s one point that I want to make sure. I mentioned it will disable all your methods so your ds methods or your DC methods for the case of new DataFlow will be disabled.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But the data, the contents in that request will remain as is so it will be really a snapshot in excel of your request as it looked that day. All right. And this functionality is available for both Classic as well as the new DataFlow. So we&#39;re building it together for both.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The applications at the same time. That&#39;s another point. I want to make sure I convey. The other thing I want to share is that. You can take as many snapshots as you need to. So essentially, if you took a snapshot.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once. We will not prevent you from taking it one more time or 13 more times, so take as many snapshots as needed. And first for most, the functionality will be available to save it in FileRoom for Classic So right here in this Documents tab, and then for the new DataFlow, it will show up in your Documents tab. In new DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This download and save into your local that functionality that&#39;s still being worked on. So by synergy time I will have it up and running for sure where you could save it. In the Documents Tab for both the application.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All right. Is there something else you would add? Am I forgetting a point. You hit it real good, right? So it basically creates it disconnects. The request from. DataFlow and stores all the data within it but does not affect impact any of the existing formula so it will still calculate if you opened it and decide to manipulate data for what if scenario you can.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s basically excel disconnected. It will not impact your stored data for DataFlow any longer. Awesome. Right. We share this internally with some of our folks, and everyone was very excited for this functionality. And again, the purpose of this. Why did we create this? Because we want you to be able to bring over.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your legacy information from Classic into the new DataFlow. In an easy format. So now that all of these are documents, they&#39;re not connected, but they are helpful in your audits. So you may</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">want to utilize the functionality Pete is about to show you, which is the Gcgf to bring prior year data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And maybe even that pull forward functionality prior year data again. But what about the data from ten years ago? How will we move all of that over? And that snapshot is supposed to be the answer for that. You&#39;re able to bring over.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your class seeker request data over into new DataFlow easily. And again, we have heard feedback that there is always a need for this type of functionality to make this request portable so you can save it going forward on a going forward basis as well. So that&#39;s why we decided that it just makes sense to make it available in both.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">New as well as a classic application. All right. That was all on snapshot again type in any questions. I am sorry this is recording so we can&#39;t really have a conversation about it. I&#39;m sure you have a lot of questions, so send those in in the chat and we&#39;ll do our best to answer them to you either right away or we&#39;ll reach back out via email.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All right. The next topic is the classic data within the new DataFlow. And pete&#39;s going to talk about it. So, Pete, do you want to. Take over. Sure. Just keep the slide up for me and then I&#39;ll take over sharing. And once I&#39;m ready to talk and talk a little bit about this.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So in the next Gen new dataflow, we&#39;ve gone ahead, and we&#39;ve implemented methods that allow you to access your data directly inside a classic request. Very similar to when you&#39;re working with those are familiar with DataFlow. You will have a request for period one, and then you&#39;ll create a request for period two, which brings over the ending balances from period one to become the beginning balances for period two. And that&#39;s a process that continues period after period after period. And you use methods.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Such as df. Get ID to find that request. Df. Get block or get table or any of those to bring over data into your next period. And allow to collect data for your ending and then proceed to your next period once again and continue. I&#39;m going to demonstrate that using.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All three of these methods down the bottom, I&#39;m going to show a template inside dataflow Classic that works from 2019. The years may be off, but either way, one year to another inside Classic and then I&#39;m going to show a very similar template in Next Gen, which will retrieve data from the previous period in Classic and then.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That same template. Without modification is going to go ahead to the prior period. In next gender the new DataFlow and continue operation from period to period without having to make any changes moving forward once you&#39;re inside. So basically what we&#39;re talking about is how can you transition smoothly during a period change and move forward inside the next generation DataFlow and keep working without interruption and.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Still be familiar. With what you&#39;re working with. So I&#39;m going to go ahead and share here. While you&#39;re bringing up the share, I just wanted to do a quick time check for you. We are at the 35 minutes Mark.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay. Thank you. Okay. So let&#39;s start here. So. My screen is up, and I don&#39;t think I need that. So. Have everybody familiar with. DataFlow. I&#39;ve gone ahead and filtered this and I&#39;m going to show a classic request real quick and this is for year 2015. My template is going to use the period for years. So in an annual period so 2015 to 2016, and then when I go to next Gen I&#39;ll be showing how it works.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2017, 2018, and maybe 2019. I don&#39;t know if I have time to go that far. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s necessary as well. So first things first. I&#39;m just going to go ahead and open this 2015 request. And you can see I have the template open the background and so 2015 this is the 2015 request. There is no 2014 request.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And what it&#39;s trying to do is it&#39;s trying to get data dfkit. Id. It&#39;s looking for a request for the prior period to populate this area, which would then be transferred to here to collect. Ending balances and any adjustments that may be required.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And so once again and then I&#39;ve put in this template last classic here just so that. My system will be able to calculate where to go looking for a request. So since this one doesn&#39;t have a prior request, I&#39;m just going to go ahead and put a little bit of data in here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So you can see it live. When I go ahead over to the other request. I&#39;ll make a handful of adjustments. And I know it doesn&#39;t calculate. But right now I&#39;m just trying to show functionality. And so the date is here. I&#39;m going to go ahead and save this request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Save data. I&#39;m going to save data from close. Attain save. So now I&#39;m going to go ahead and open the 2016 request and show that data coming over. And I&#39;ll talk a little bit about the design here and the differences between the two in a moment. So you see, this one didn&#39;t give me the Dfkit ID. No results return because this one here.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Actually found a request. Right the template name in the year and it populated data. These are the values you saw me input. And those are then populated here. I have input some ending balances and these ending bounces are what I&#39;ll be looking for.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the next. Request. I&#39;m just going to paste this down. And once again, I&#39;m going to save this request. So what this has done, this is a 2016 request. It looked at 2015 and brought the data over. Save the data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Save data form close. And now I&#39;m going to go ahead to the new data file. And you can see I&#39;ve got requests. And since I last request. In classic was 2016. My 2017 request should be pulling over all those four.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Classic. And you&#39;ll see this template looks almost exactly the same as the classic request. The tab names will be a little different. Do you mind adjusting a little bit? Your audio a little louder, please.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Find. I just feel like it could be a little louder. I&#39;ll try talking a little louder myself. Okay. So what this had done is this one used the Dcdf method. Right, dcf Kid ID. To reach the classic to get the request ID to run.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Dcdf get block. To retrieve the data. And there are all the fours you saw me put in. As you saw, I didn&#39;t copy them all the way down. And they All Appeared here. And so now I&#39;m going to go ahead and close this request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wait a minute, let me cancel for a moment. I forgot to cover the inputs. So these inputs are 1234. You&#39;ll see that I&#39;ve just input a couple of values here. Now go ahead and save this request. And then using the same template and you&#39;ll see inside the grade, they&#39;re all based off of the same template. So the template that just pulled.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From classic is the same one that&#39;s going to pull from. The new DataFlow. So I&#39;m going to open the 2018 request. Sometimes. Whenever you want to show anything, it always shows. That boring. So it&#39;s pulled that data over and you can see my values here and this is using instead of the dcdf get ID.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s using the DC. Get ID. To get the request ID for. The new DataFlow request and then down here it&#39;s doing the same thing. Instead of using Dcdf get block it&#39;s using DC get range to pull data from.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A data new DataFlow request. I&#39;m going to ignore changes there you can see my number is 1097. I just close our request. And let&#39;s talk about the templates. So I&#39;ve got the template open here. And I believe this is the template there. Yes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So time check, pro. Are we doing okay. We&#39;re only at 47 minutes. You got about. Ten. So you see, these templates are basically the same. There&#39;s no real difference, right. You see, the reserve names are pretty much the same with dataflow Classic. You had Data Collection Request ID and request ID as a reserve name.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In dataflow we no longer carry forward to DataFlow collection request ID. We only support request ID. Specialty. See two separate blocks here. You&#39;ll see the tabs Difference, DataFlow and dataflow classic. Right. So I&#39;m going to bring this here and just bring it up.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So this is DataFlow. So inside DataFlow. You&#39;ll see. That we have a DC range here. In dataflow classic. This is a block. So you&#39;ll see there. Right. And the reason this is actually the same more booked or is actually a hidden tab in here. So when you solve the multiple names in there for both Classic and Next Gen does because of those two changes. But you&#39;ll see it almost exactly the same. They&#39;re behaving pretty much the same. Right. We&#39;re getting balance.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Is being brought over. Will be a vlookup prior year accounts formals are basically the same. The landing areas. Are almost exactly the same, but after converting the template over. I went from what was originally a template designed.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For dataflow Classic using df get ID only. This one using Dfget block exclusively. This is a classic template. I went ahead and modified those methods, even though the converter converted some of them. For me, I modified these methods to actually be conditional. To look at the year of the request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The year of the template and what year I had told it on the information sheet was the last year for Classic to make a determination. On what method to use should it use. The dcd get ID to go looking in classic or should it use the DC get ID to go looking in the new dataflow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the same goes for. To get block do I get it from classic. Or do I get it from the new DataFlow? This template can then be used from period to period, moving forward. One of the things I forgot to mention is down here. I went ahead and just put a get list.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That&#39;s looking for a specific request just to show that Dcdf get list also works. You may have seen that when I opened the request and populate over there over here, you&#39;ll see just some that I&#39;m doing some basic checks. And these are what I&#39;m using to drive these formulas.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To determine what method to use. Right. So I&#39;m checking which method I should use. And these formulas are just here to demonstrate how I&#39;m using that logic to make that determination. And that&#39;s pretty much Dcdf in a nutshell.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the reason why we wanted to show it to you all and have Pete show you a live template working. Was because. We believe. These matters will make transitioning over much more, easier. Because you will be able to create your new DataFlow template. Incorporate these methods to bring over your prior year information that&#39;s still living in Classic because remember, you can have both Classic and the new DataFlow application running in your instance. At the same time, you can have both the apps running.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At one point and the second is. You can actually now communicate between the two apps, so you can use these methods to design your template a little bit, but you will be able to bring in your prior year data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From your DataFlow traffic. Right. But then it&#39;s not that you have to again go tweak these templates in the year 23, for instance. That&#39;s not the case, because as Pete showed you. You can just use formulas in there to say depending on the year value, you want to either pull it from this classic request versus.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You want to now work with the new data for request going forward. So if you work with our implementation team, they&#39;ll be able to show you get into the weeds of this and talk about this much more. If you&#39;re coming to synergy, come and buy Pete or myself.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That will be happy to talk a little bit more about these things with you. But again, the goal is that. You don&#39;t have to wait for the roll forward. Because this is essentially letting you pull plastic data over to the new DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All right, next is the roll forward from classic to new DataFlow. So, Tim, know everything you saw. Excluding snapshot. Snapshot will be available by November. This functionality is essentially available to you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rolling forward from classic to new DataFlow is something that working towards making it available to you. The precursor to this, we believe is the ability to see your classic request displayed in your new DataFlow right next to your request grid. So you saw Pete bring it up, and I have it here. Here&#39;s a request grid. Right. We envision a classic grid.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Right within here where you can pull in. You can see your classic request. You can actually work on them and you can open them. You can work on it. Save it. With the exception of creating new requests, we see you using that area, and then you can also roll forward from class section your DataFlow right from there. And we.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Feel that visually being able to do it from the same application versus going in classic to initiate going forward is a little bit of a disconnect. So that&#39;s the next feature that we want to work towards making it available to you and I will leave it at coming soon. It&#39;s scheduled for next year.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With that let me move on to roadmaps so in our roadmap. We don&#39;t want to go in. Let me just talk about what we already shared, right? We talked about. We showed you some of the functionality. We showed you the Data Hub integration. What we didn&#39;t talk about is the role forward to a different tempered version. This functionality just became available with our September release, so you can now roll forward to.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A different template. While doing all of this, we wanted to make sure that you feel supported. So any support tickets that come in. We work on that as our highest priority. In addition to that. We also are new clients who are transitioning right now to the new DataFlow.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are giving them the white glove treatment or the extra additional support. So not only we have our support team on standby and our implementation team is available for you to talk to and discuss things.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But in the park management side also, I have carved out time to make sure I&#39;m able to move with you. And then we also have development time carved out dedicated to provide that accelerated or quick support.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Should something come up, we want to be able to turn around on it really quickly, so we will continue to do that hopefully in early 22 as well. So if you&#39;re thinking about converting if you&#39;re on the fence at all, my help is that after looking at all the tools available, the fact that you can have both the products working in the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">System at the same time. You would think about moving over it&#39;s. Not all of your processes, but maybe part of your processes. Let&#39;s take a look at what we are focused towards delivering in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">22. Of course, we want to continue to support classic DataFlow. Classic DataFlow is not going away.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are working towards. Providing you tools to move off of classic DataFlow. We eventually want to stop supporting it, but that date has not been set yet, so if you&#39;ve heard otherwise, anywhere. Please take my word for it. That&#39;s not the correct information.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Classic DataFlow is here to stay. It&#39;s not going away, not. You have all these tools available. And we are all working towards the transition plan or transitioning over. All right. Next year, we want to continue to create more transition tools. So I talked about going forward and viewing your classic request.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the next Gen area or the new DataFlow area. We also want to create a web based DataFlow. So it says. 22. This is something that is projecting out of 22 right now. Again, by the time the live synergy happens, depending on how things share, we might be able to actually pull it into 22, but that&#39;s and we know that you want to access your DataFlows on your ipads, and as we are moving more and more towards.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud based applications. It&#39;s just a natural next step for DataFlow also, so that&#39;s something that we&#39;re looking towards. But other than that, here is a list of some of the other functionality that we are focused on delivering.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay, if you have any questions, drop them in the chat. We will do our best to get back to you. In closing, I didn&#39;t want to talk about community, so bear with me 1 second as I read through this. So community is available to you.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I would like to invite you to join our Thompson burgers community to build on today&#39;s discussion or participate in discussions on other topic of interest. There are a number of groups in the community so that you can focus on discussions related to ONESOURCE, checkpoint, altrics, et cetera.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It&#39;s a great space for you to interact with each other and us just point your camera here, so we&#39;ll just pull right up on your phone and you can then just sign up. And be part of the conversation.</p></body></html>
